Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractA regularization technique based on adversarial perturbation, which was initially developed in the field of image processing, has been successfully applied to text classification tasks and has yielded attractive improvements. We aim to further leverage this promising methodology into more sophisticated and critical neural models in the natural language processing field, i.e., neural machine translation (NMT) models. However, it is not trivial to apply this methodology to such models. Thus, this paper investigates the effectiveness of several possible configurations of applying the adversarial perturbation and reveals that the adversarial regularization technique can significantly and consistently improve the performance of widely used NMT models, such as LSTM-based and Transformer-based models.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1020,,Effective Adversarial Regularization for Neural Machine Translation,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1020/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Under this architecture, the search space of candidate answers can be greatly reduced without sacrificing the coverage of correct answers and the syntactic, hierarchical and compositional structure among constituents can be well captured, which contributes to better representation learning of the candidate answers.

To achieve this, we adapt neural sequence models to map utterances directly to SQL with its full expressivity, bypassing any intermediate meaning representations. These models are immediately deployed online to solicit feedback from real users to flag incorrect queries. Finally, the popularity of SQL facilitates gathering annotations for incorrect predictions using the crowd, which is directly used to improve our models. This complete feedback loop, without intermediate representations or database specific engineering, opens up new ways of building high quality semantic parsers.

We propose a unified learning framework that collectively addresses all the above issues by composing a committee of discriminators that can guide a base RNN generator towards more globally coherent generations. More concretely, discriminators each specialize in a different principle of communication, such as Grice’s maxims, and are collectively combined with the base RNN generator through a composite decoding objective. Human evaluation demonstrates that text generated by our model is preferred over that of baselines by a large margin, significantly enhancing the overall coherence, style, and information of the generations.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1152,,Learning to Write with Cooperative Discriminators,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P18/P18-1152/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Although being able to model non-local semantic information, a sequence LSTM can lose information from the AMR graph structure, and thus facing challenges with large-graphs, which result in long sequences.

Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers),https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P18-1/,2018,"AbstractA knowledge base is a large repository of facts that are mainly represented as RDF triples, each of which consists of a subject, a predicate (relationship), and an object. The RDF triple representation offers a simple interface for applications to access the facts. However, this representation is not in a natural language form, which is difficult for humans to understand. We address this problem by proposing a system to translate a set of RDF triples into natural sentences based on an encoder-decoder framework. To preserve as much information from RDF triples as possible, we propose a novel graph-based triple encoder. The proposed encoder encodes not only the elements of the triples but also the relationships both within a triple and between the triples. Experimental results show that the proposed encoder achieves a consistent improvement over the baseline models by up to 17.6%, 6.0%, and 16.4% in three common metrics BLEU, METEOR, and TER, respectively.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1151,,GTR-LSTM: A Triple Encoder for Sentence Generation from RDF Data,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P18/P18-1151/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

However, it is known that sampling methods are biased especially when the sampling distribution deviates from the true data distribution. Besides, SGD suffers from dramatic fluctuation due to the one-sample learning scheme. In this work, we propose AllVec that uses batch gradient learning to generate word representations from all training samples.

OONP supports a big variety of forms (both symbolic and differentiable) for representing the state and the document, and a rich family of operations to compose the representation. An OONP parser can be trained with supervision of different forms and strength, including supervised learning (SL), reinforcement learning (RL) and hybrid of the two.

In this paper, we extend their approach to support non-projectivity by providing the first practical implementation of the MH₄ algorithm, an O(n4) mildly nonprojective dynamic-programming parser with very high coverage on non-projective treebanks. To make MH₄ compatible with minimal transition-based feature sets, we introduce a transition-based interpretation of it in which parser items are mapped to sequences of transitions.

In this paper we propose a method for cross-lingual morphological tagging that aims to improve information sharing between languages by relaxing this assumption. The proposed model uses factorial conditional random fields with neural network potentials, making it possible to (1) utilize the expressive power of neural network representations to smooth over superficial differences in the surface forms, (2) model pairwise and transitive relationships between tags, and (3) accurately generate tag sets that are unseen or rare in the training data.

However, these encodings do not consider a context wider than a single word and it is only through subsequent recurrent layers that word or sub-word information interacts.

To do this, we first we model text quality as a function of three properties - organization, coherence and cohesion. Then, we demonstrate how capturing gaze behaviour helps in predicting each of these properties, and hence the overall quality, by reporting improvements obtained by adding gaze features to traditional textual features for score prediction.

However, even though it is an efficient method, it does not come at no cost—The resulted distantly-supervised training samples are often very noisy. To combat the noise, most of the recent state-of-the-art approaches focus on selecting one-best sentence or calculating soft attention weights over the set of the sentences of one specific entity pair. However, these methods are suboptimal, and the false positive problem is still a key stumbling bottleneck for the performance. We argue that those incorrectly-labeled candidate sentences must be treated with a hard decision, rather than being dealt with soft attention weights.

To overcome these limitations we build upon the recent reward augmented maximum likelihood approach that encourages the model to predict sentences that are close to the ground truth according to a given performance metric.

To address this problem, we propose an end-to-end neural model that enables those answer candidates from different passages to verify each other based on their content representations. Specifically, we jointly train three modules that can predict the final answer based on three factors: the answer boundary, the answer content and the cross-passage answer verification.

We tackle the task of aspect-based summarization, where, given a document and a target aspect, our models generate a summary centered around the aspect. We induce latent document structure jointly with an abstractive summarization objective, and train our models in a scalable synthetic setup. In addition to improvements in summarization over topic-agnostic baselines, we demonstrate the benefit of the learnt document structure: we show that our models (a) learn to accurately segment documents by aspect; (b) can leverage the structure to produce both abstractive and extractive aspect-based summaries; and (c) that structure is particularly advantageous for summarizing long documents.

First, a large search space of potential programs needs to be explored at training time to find a correct program. Second, spurious programs that accidentally lead to a correct denotation add noise to training. In this work we propose that in closed worlds with clear semantic types, one can substantially alleviate these problems by utilizing an abstract representation, where tokens in both the language utterance and program are lifted to an abstract form. We show that these abstractions can be defined with a handful of lexical rules and that they result in sharing between different examples that alleviates the difficulties in training. To test our approach, we develop the first semantic parser for CNLVR, a challenging visual reasoning dataset, where the search space is large and overcoming spuriousness is critical, because denotations are either TRUE or FALSE, and thus random programs are likely to lead to a correct denotation.

In this work we take a fine-grained look at the different architectures for NMT. We introduce an Architecture Definition Language (ADL) allowing for a flexible combination of common building blocks. Making use of this language we show in experiments that one can bring recurrent and convolutional models very close to the Transformer performance by borrowing concepts from the Transformer architecture, but not using self-attention. Additionally, we find that self-attention is much more important on the encoder side than on the decoder side, where it can be replaced by a RNN or CNN without a loss in performance in most settings.

Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers),https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P18-1/,2018,"AbstractIn neural machine translation, a source sequence of words is encoded into a vector from which a target sequence is generated in the decoding phase. Differently from statistical machine translation, the associations between source words and their possible target counterparts are not explicitly stored. Source and target words are at the two ends of a long information processing procedure, mediated by hidden states at both the source encoding and the target decoding phases. This makes it possible that a source word is incorrectly translated into a target word that is not any of its admissible equivalent counterparts in the target language. In this paper, we seek to somewhat shorten the distance between source and target words in that procedure, and thus strengthen their association, by means of a method we term bridging source and target word embeddings. We experiment with three strategies: (1) a source-side bridging model, where source word embeddings are moved one step closer to the output target sequence; (2) a target-side bridging model, which explores the more relevant source word embeddings for the prediction of the target sequence; and (3) a direct bridging model, which directly connects source and target word embeddings seeking to minimize errors in the translation of ones by the others. Experiments and analysis presented in this paper demonstrate that the proposed bridging models are able to significantly improve quality of both sentence translation, in general, and alignment and translation of individual source words with target words, in particular.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1164,,Attention Focusing for Neural Machine Translation by Bridging Source and Target Embeddings,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P18/P18-1164/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

DuoRC contains 186,089 unique question-answer pairs created from a collection of 7680 pairs of movie plots where each pair in the collection reflects two versions of the same movie - one from Wikipedia and the other from IMDb - written by two different authors. We asked crowdsourced workers to create questions from one version of the plot and a different set of workers to extract or synthesize answers from the other version. This unique characteristic of DuoRC where questions and answers are created from different versions of a document narrating the same underlying story, ensures by design, that there is very little lexical overlap between the questions created from one version and the segments containing the answer in the other version. Further, since the two versions have different levels of plot detail, narration style, vocabulary, etc., answering questions from the second version requires deeper language understanding and incorporating external background knowledge. Additionally, the narrative style of passages arising from movie plots (as opposed to typical descriptive passages in existing datasets) exhibits the need to perform complex reasoning over events across multiple sentences. Indeed, we observe that state-of-the-art neural RC models which have achieved near human performance on the SQuAD dataset, even when coupled with traditional NLP techniques to address the challenges presented in DuoRC exhibit very poor performance (F1 score of 37.42% on DuoRC v/s 86% on SQuAD dataset).

However, such systems are difficult to apply to problems involving natural language, due to its large linguistic variability. In contrast, neural models can cope very well with ambiguity by learning distributed representations of words and their composition from data, but lead to models that are difficult to interpret. In this paper, we describe a model combining neural networks with logic programming in a novel manner for solving multi-hop reasoning tasks over natural language. Specifically, we propose to use an Prolog prover which we extend to utilize a similarity function over pretrained sentence encoders. We fine-tune the representations for the similarity function via backpropagation. This leads to a system that can apply rule-based reasoning to natural language, and induce domain-specific natural language rules from training data. We evaluate the proposed system on two different question answering tasks, showing that it outperforms two baselines – BiDAF (Seo et al., 2016a) and FastQA( Weissenborn et al., 2017) on a subset of the WikiHop corpus and achieves competitive results on the MedHop data set (Welbl et al., 2017).",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1618,,NLProlog: Reasoning with Weak Unification for Question Answering in Natural Language,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1618/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

In contrast, this work proposes RankQA: RankQA extends the conventional two-stage process in neural QA with a third stage that performs an additional answer re-ranking. The re-ranking leverages different features that are directly extracted from the QA pipeline, i.e., a combination of retrieval and comprehension features. While our intentionally simple design allows for an efficient, data-sparse estimation, it nevertheless outperforms more complex QA systems by a significant margin: in fact, RankQA achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3 out of 4 benchmark datasets. Furthermore, its performance is especially superior in settings where the size of the corpus is dynamic.

The current Seq2Seq model fails to meet these diverse requirements, by using a general average likelihood as the optimization criteria. As a result, it usually generates safe and commonplace responses, such as ‘I don’t know’. In this paper, we propose two tailored optimization criteria for Seq2Seq to different conversation scenarios, i.e., the maximum generated likelihood for specific-requirement scenario, and the conditional value-at-risk for diverse-requirement scenario.

First is the lack of story corpus which has fine-grained sentiment labels. Second is the difficulty of explicitly controlling sentiment intensity when generating endings. Therefore, we propose a generic and novel framework which consists of a sentiment analyzer and a sentimental generator, respectively addressing the two challenges. The sentiment analyzer adopts a series of methods to acquire sentiment intensities of the story dataset. The sentimental generator introduces the sentiment intensity into decoder via a Gaussian Kernel Layer to control the sentiment of the output.

First, human attention is represented by the reading duration estimated from eye-tracking corpus. Then, we merge human attention with neural network models by an attention mechanism.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractNamed entity recognition (NER) is the backbone of many NLP solutions. F1 score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is often used to select/evaluate the best models. However, when precision needs to be prioritized over recall, a state-of-the-art model might not be the best choice. There is little in literature that directly addresses training-time modifications to achieve higher precision information extraction. In this paper, we propose a neural semi-Markov structured support vector machine model that controls the precision-recall trade-off by assigning weights to different types of errors in the loss-augmented inference during training. The semi-Markov property provides more accurate phrase-level predictions, thereby improving performance. We empirically demonstrate the advantage of our model when high precision is required by comparing against strong baselines based on CRF.

Combining pointer networks (Vinyals et al., 2015) with an internal stack, the proposed model first reads and encodes the whole sentence, then builds the dependency tree top-down (from root-to-leaf) in a depth-first fashion. The stack tracks the status of the depth-first search and the pointer networks select one child for the word at the top of the stack at each step. The StackPtr parser benefits from the information of whole sentence and all previously derived subtree structures, and removes the left-to-right restriction in classical transition-based parsers. Yet the number of steps for building any (non-projective) parse tree is linear in the length of the sentence just as other transition-based parsers, yielding an efficient decoding algorithm with O(n2) time complexity.

We introduce a method to create privacy-preserving shareable representations of medical text (i.e. they contain no PHI) that does not require expensive manual pseudonymization. These representations can be shared between organizations to create unified datasets for training de-identification models. Our representation allows training a simple LSTM-CRF de-identification model to an F1 score of 97.4%, which is comparable to a strong baseline that exposes private information in its representation. A robust, widely available de-identification classifier based on our representation could potentially enable studies for which de-identification would otherwise be too costly.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1584,,Adversarial Learning of Privacy-Preserving Text Representations for De-Identification of Medical Records,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1584/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Previous generative conversational models usually employ a single model to learn the relationship between different utterance-response pairs, thus tend to favor general and trivial responses which appear frequently. To address this problem, we propose a novel controlled response generation mechanism to handle different utterance-response relationships in terms of specificity. Specifically, we introduce an explicit specificity control variable into a sequence-to-sequence model, which interacts with the usage representation of words through a Gaussian Kernel layer, to guide the model to generate responses at different specificity levels.

Relation Networks (RNs), on the other hand, have shown outstanding results in relational reasoning tasks. Unfortunately, their computational cost grows quadratically with the number of memories, something prohibitive for larger problems.

It’s practical that a conversation takes place under a background, meanwhile, the query and response are usually most related and they are consistent in topic but also different in content. However, little work focuses on such hierarchical relationship among utterances. To address this problem, we propose a Conversational Semantic Relationship RNN (CSRR) model to construct the dependency explicitly. The model contains latent variables in three hierarchies. The discourse-level one captures the global background, the pair-level one stands for the common topic information between query and response, and the utterance-level ones try to represent differences in content.

Beyond confidence estimation, we identify which parts of the input contribute to uncertain predictions allowing users to interpret their model, and verify or refine its input.

In this work, we propose a novel approach to support value extraction scaling up to thousands of attributes without losing performance: (1) We propose to regard attribute as a query and adopt only one global set of BIO tags for any attributes to reduce the burden of attribute tag or model explosion; (2) We explicitly model the semantic representations for attribute and title, and develop an attention mechanism to capture the interactive semantic relations in-between to enforce our framework to be attribute comprehensive. We conduct extensive experiments in real-life datasets.

Specifically, we propose Anchor-Region Networks (ARNs), a sequence-to-nuggets architecture for nested mention detection. ARNs first identify anchor words (i.e., possible head words) of all mentions, and then recognize the mention boundaries for each anchor word by exploiting regular phrase structures.

We study how the controlled characteristics of our miniature languages affect individual learning and their stability across multiple network generations. The results draw a mixed picture. On the one hand, neural networks show a strong tendency to avoid long-distance dependencies.

By using a chunk rather than a word as the basic translation unit, local (intra-chunk) and global (inter-chunk) word orders and dependencies can be easily modeled.

In this paper, we take the first step on teaching machines to ask open-answered questions from real-world news for open discussion (openQG). To generate high-qualified questions, effective ways for question evaluation are required. We take the perspective that the more answers a question receives, the better it is for open discussion, and analyze how language use affects the number of answers. Compared with other factors, e.g. topic and post time, linguistic factors keep our evaluation from being domain-specific. We carefully perform variable control on 11.5M questions from online forums to get a dataset, OQRanD, and further perform question analysis. Based on these conclusions, several models are built for question evaluation. For openQG task, we construct OQGenD, the first dataset as far as we know, and propose a model based on conditional generative adversarial networks and our question evaluation model.

In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to this problem that builds on the recent work on unsupervised machine translation. This way, instead of directly inducing a bilingual lexicon from cross-lingual embeddings, we use them to build a phrase-table, combine it with a language model, and use the resulting machine translation system to generate a synthetic parallel corpus, from which we extract the bilingual lexicon using statistical word alignment techniques. As such, our method can work with any word embedding and cross-lingual mapping technique, and it does not require any additional resource besides the monolingual corpus used to train the embeddings. When evaluated on the exact same cross-lingual embeddings, our proposed method obtains an average improvement of 6 accuracy points over nearest neighbor and 4 points over CSLS retrieval, establishing a new state-of-the-art in the standard MUSE dataset.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1494,,Bilingual Lexicon Induction through Unsupervised Machine Translation,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1494/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

To understand why, we present a large number of probing experiments, showing that transfer is possible even to languages in different scripts, that transfer works best between typologically similar languages, that monolingual corpora can train models for code-switching, and that the model can find translation pairs.

While several authors have questioned the underlying isomorphism assumption, which states that word embeddings in different languages have approximately the same structure, it is not clear whether this is an inherent limitation of mapping approaches or a more general issue when learning cross-lingual embeddings. So as to answer this question, we experiment with parallel corpora, which allows us to compare offline mapping to an extension of skip-gram that jointly learns both embedding spaces. We observe that, under these ideal conditions, joint learning yields to more isomorphic embeddings, is less sensitive to hubness, and obtains stronger results in bilingual lexicon induction. We thus conclude that current mapping methods do have strong limitations, calling for further research to jointly learn cross-lingual embeddings with a weaker cross-lingual signal.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1492,,Analyzing the Limitations of Cross-lingual Word Embedding Mappings,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1492/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

An important requirement for many downstream tasks is that word similarity should be independent of language—i.e., word vectors within one language should not be more similar to each other than to words in another language. We measure this characteristic using modularity, a network measurement that measures the strength of clusters in a graph. Modularity has a moderate to strong correlation with three downstream tasks, even though modularity is based only on the structure of embeddings and does not require any external resources. We show through experiments that modularity can serve as an intrinsic validation metric to improve unsupervised cross-lingual word embeddings, particularly on distant language pairs in low-resource settings.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1489,,A Resource-Free Evaluation Metric for Cross-Lingual Word Embeddings Based on Graph Modularity,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1489/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

The model is highly sensitive to the order of words within the most recent sentence, but ignores word order in the long-range context (beyond 50 tokens), suggesting the distant past is modeled only as a rough semantic field or topic.

In this work we show that a broad class of models that assign probability measures to OE can never capture negative correlation, which motivates our construction of a novel box lattice and accompanying probability measure to capture anti-correlation and even disjoint concepts, while still providing the benefits of probabilistic modeling, such as the ability to perform rich joint and conditional queries over arbitrary sets of concepts, and both learning from and predicting calibrated uncertainty.

Many of these tasks are of a categorical prediction variety: given a conditioning context (e.g., an NLI premise), provide a label based on an associated prompt (e.g., an NLI hypothesis). The categorical nature of these tasks has led to common use of a cross entropy log-loss objective during training. We suggest this loss is intuitively wrong when applied to plausibility tasks, where the prompt by design is neither categorically entailed nor contradictory given the context. Log-loss naturally drives models to assign scores near 0.0 or 1.0, in contrast to our proposed use of a margin-based loss.

However, the fundamental challenge lies in obtaining high-quality annotations of (utterance, program) pairs across various domains needed for training such models. To overcome this, we propose a novel framework to build a unified multi-domain enabled semantic parser trained only with weak supervision (denotations). Weakly supervised training is particularly arduous as the program search space grows exponentially in a multi-domain setting. To solve this, we incorporate a multi-policy distillation mechanism in which we first train domain-specific semantic parsers (teachers) using weak supervision in the absence of the ground truth programs, followed by training a single unified parser (student) from the domain specific policies obtained from these teachers. The resultant semantic parser is not only compact but also generalizes better, and generates more accurate programs. It further does not require the user to provide a domain label while querying.

Does this mean that machines can perform human level commonsense inference? In this paper, we show that commonsense inference still proves difficult for even state-of-the-art models, by presenting HellaSwag, a new challenge dataset. Though its questions are trivial for humans (>95% accuracy), state-of-the-art models struggle (<48%). We achieve this via Adversarial Filtering (AF), a data collection paradigm wherein a series of discriminators iteratively select an adversarial set of machine-generated wrong answers. AF proves to be surprisingly robust. The key insight is to scale up the length and complexity of the dataset examples towards a critical ‘Goldilocks’ zone wherein generated text is ridiculous to humans, yet often misclassified by state-of-the-art models. Our construction of HellaSwag, and its resulting difficulty, sheds light on the inner workings of deep pretrained models.

Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers),https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P17-1/,2017,"AbstractTo enable human-robot communication and collaboration, previous works represent grounded verb semantics as the potential change of state to the physical world caused by these verbs. Grounded verb semantics are acquired mainly based on the parallel data of the use of a verb phrase and its corresponding sequences of primitive actions demonstrated by humans. The rich interaction between teachers and students that is considered important in learning new skills has not yet been explored. To address this limitation, this paper presents a new interactive learning approach that allows robots to proactively engage in interaction with human partners by asking good questions to learn models for grounded verb semantics. The proposed approach uses reinforcement learning to allow the robot to acquire an optimal policy for its question-asking behaviors by maximizing the long-term reward. Our empirical results have shown that the interactive learning approach leads to more reliable models for grounded verb semantics, especially in the noisy environment which is full of uncertainties. Compared to previous work, the models acquired from interactive learning result in a 48% to 145% performance gain when applied in new situations.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1150,,Interactive Learning of Grounded Verb Semantics towards Human-Robot Communication,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P17/P17-1150/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

MT-DNN not only leverages large amounts of cross-task data, but also benefits from a regularization effect that leads to more general representations to help adapt to new tasks and domains. MT-DNN extends the model proposed in Liu et al. (2015) by incorporating a pre-trained bidirectional transformer language model, known as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018). MT-DNN obtains new state-of-the-art results on ten NLU tasks, including SNLI, SciTail, and eight out of nine GLUE tasks, pushing the GLUE benchmark to 82.7% (2.2% absolute improvement) as of February 25, 2019 on the latest GLUE test set.

Linguistic features, mainly from parsers, have been used to detect MCI, but this is not suitable for large-scale assessments. MCI disfluencies produce non-grammatical speech that requires manual or high precision automatic correction of transcripts. In this paper, we modeled transcripts into complex networks and enriched them with word embedding (CNE) to better represent short texts produced in neuropsychological assessments. The network measurements were applied with well-known classifiers to automatically identify MCI in transcripts, in a binary classification task. A comparison was made with the performance of traditional approaches using Bag of Words (BoW) and linguistic features for three datasets: DementiaBank in English, and Cinderella and Arizona-Battery in Portuguese. Overall, CNE provided higher accuracy than using only complex networks, while Support Vector Machine was superior to other classifiers. CNE provided the highest accuracies for DementiaBank and Cinderella, but BoW was more efficient for the Arizona-Battery dataset probably owing to its short narratives. The approach using linguistic features yielded higher accuracy if the transcriptions of the Cinderella dataset were manually revised.

However, these models often overlook explicit temporal signals, such as dates and time windows. Rule-based methods can be used to identify the temporal links between these time expressions (timexes), but they fail to capture timexes’ interactions with events and are hard to integrate with the distributed representations of neural net models. In this paper, we introduce a framework to infuse temporal awareness into such models by learning a pre-trained model to embed timexes. We generate synthetic data consisting of pairs of timexes, then train a character LSTM to learn embeddings and classify the timexes’ temporal relation. We evaluate the utility of these embeddings in the context of a strong neural model for event temporal ordering, and show a small increase in performance on the MATRES dataset and more substantial gains on an automatically collected dataset with more frequent event-timex interactions.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1433,,Embedding Time Expressions for Deep Temporal Ordering Models,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1433/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Furthermore, word-level training requires strict matching between the generated sequence and the ground truth sequence which leads to overcorrection over different but reasonable translations.

In this paper, we introduce an alternative reward function for optimizing NMT systems that is based on recent work in semantic similarity. We evaluate on four disparate languages trans-lated to English, and find that training with our proposed metric results in better translations as evaluated by BLEU, semantic similarity, and human evaluation, and also that the optimization procedure converges faster.

Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers),https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P17-1/,2017,"AbstractLexical resources such as dictionaries and gazetteers are often used as auxiliary data for tasks such as part-of-speech induction and named-entity recognition. However, discriminative training with lexical features requires annotated data to reliably estimate the lexical feature weights and may result in overfitting the lexical features at the expense of features which generalize better. In this paper, we investigate a more robust approach: we stipulate that the lexicon is the result of an assumed generative process. Practically, this means that we may treat the lexical resources as observations under the proposed generative model. The lexical resources provide training data for the generative model without requiring separate data to estimate lexical feature weights. We evaluate the proposed approach in two settings: part-of-speech induction and low-resource named-entity recognition.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1095,,Bayesian Modeling of Lexical Resources for Low-Resource Settings,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P17/P17-1095/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

On the other hand, query-based summarization highlights those points that are relevant in the context of a given query. The encode-attend-decode paradigm has achieved notable success in machine translation, extractive summarization, dialog systems, etc. But it suffers from the drawback of generation of repeated phrases. In this work we propose a model for the query-based summarization task based on the encode-attend-decode paradigm with two key additions (i) a query attention model (in addition to document attention model) which learns to focus on different portions of the query at different time steps (instead of using a static representation for the query) and (ii) a new diversity based attention model which aims to alleviate the problem of repeating phrases in the summary. In order to enable the testing of this model we introduce a new query-based summarization dataset building on debatepedia.

In CTA, often heavy human labor is involved to parse the interview transcript into structured knowledge (e.g., flowchart for different actions). To reduce human efforts and scale the process, automated CTA transcript parsing is desirable. However, this task has unique challenges as (1) it requires the understanding of long-range context information in conversational text; and (2) the amount of labeled data is limited and indirect—i.e., context-aware, noisy, and low-resource. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised information extraction framework for automated CTA transcript parsing. We partition the parsing process into a sequence labeling task and a text span-pair relation extraction task, with distant supervision from human-curated protocol files.

How to learn accurate representations of these words to augment a pre-trained embedding by only a few observations is a challenging research problem. In this paper, we formulate the learning of OOV embedding as a few-shot regression problem by fitting a representation function to predict an oracle embedding vector (defined as embedding trained with abundant observations) based on limited contexts. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical attention network-based embedding framework to serve as the neural regression function, in which the context information of a word is encoded and aggregated from K observations. Furthermore, we propose to use Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for adapting the learned model to the new corpus fast and robustly.

However, existing natural language interfaces for such tasks are quite primitive compared to the power one wields with a programming language. To bridge this gap, we start with a core programming language and allow users to “naturalize” the core language incrementally by defining alternative, more natural syntax and increasingly complex concepts in terms of compositions of simpler ones. In a voxel world, we show that a community of users can simultaneously teach a common system a diverse language and use it to build hundreds of complex voxel structures.

We introduce a new sample-efficient method that learns the AL policy directly on the target domain of interest by using wake and dream cycles. Our approach interleaves between querying the annotation of the selected datapoints to update the underlying student learner and improving AL policy using simulation where the current student learner acts as an imperfect annotator. We evaluate our method on cross-domain and cross-lingual text classification and named entity recognition tasks.

Therefore, the inverse of the decoding function serves as another encoder that produces sentence representations.

The whole resource contains 155k tokens and 1,526 collocations labeled in context. The annotated examples belong to three syntactic relations (adjective-noun, verb-object, and nominal compounds), and represent 58 lexical functions in the Meaning-Text Theory (e.g., Oper, Magn, Bon, etc.). Each collocation was annotated by three linguists and the final resource was revised by a team of experts. The resulting corpus can serve as a basis to evaluate different approaches for collocation identification, which in turn can be useful for different NLP tasks such as natural language understanding or natural language generation.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1392,,Pay Attention when you Pay the Bills.

Nevertheless, progress on dimension-specific essay scoring is limited in part by the lack of annotated corpora. To facilitate advances in this area, we design a scoring rubric for scoring a core, yet unexplored dimension of persuasive essay quality, thesis strength, and annotate a corpus of essays with thesis strength scores. We additionally identify the attributes that could impact thesis strength and annotate the essays with the values of these attributes, which, when predicted by computational models, could provide further feedback to students on why her essay receives a particular thesis strength score.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1390,,Give Me More Feedback II: Annotating Thesis Strength and Related Attributes in Student Essays,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1390/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

This creates an immense scope, in the field of natural language processing toward developing automated tools for content moderation and review. In this paper we propose Self Attentive Revision Encoder (StRE) which leverages orthographic similarity of lexical units toward predicting the quality of new edits. In contrast to existing propositions which primarily employ features like page reputation, editor activity or rule based heuristics, we utilize the textual content of the edits which, we believe contains superior signatures of their quality. More specifically, we deploy deep encoders to generate representations of the edits from its text content, which we then leverage to infer quality. We further contribute a novel dataset containing ∼ 21M revisions across 32K Wikipedia pages and demonstrate that StRE outperforms existing methods by a significant margin – at least 17% and at most 103%. Our pre-trained model achieves such result after retraining on a set as small as 20% of the edits in a wikipage.

We introduce three methods, namely attentional concatenation, feature-based gating and affine transformation. Experiments on six benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our methods.

Previous coreference resolution tasks can largely be solved by exploiting the number and gender of the antecedents, or have been handcrafted and do not reflect the diversity of naturally occurring text. We present a corpus of over 8,000 annotated text passages with ambiguous pronominal anaphora. These instances are both challenging and realistic. We show that various coreference systems, whether rule-based, feature-rich, or neural, perform significantly worse on the task than humans, who display high inter-annotator agreement. To explain this performance gap, we show empirically that state-of-the art models often fail to capture context, instead relying on the gender or number of candidate antecedents to make a decision. We then use problem-specific insights to propose a data-augmentation trick called antecedent switching to alleviate this tendency in models. Finally, we show that antecedent switching yields promising results on other tasks as well: we use it to achieve state-of-the-art results on the GAP coreference task.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1386,,The KnowRef Coreference Corpus: Removing Gender and Number Cues for Difficult Pronominal Anaphora Resolution,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1386/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractEmbedding a clause inside another (“the girl [who likes cars [that run fast]] has arrived”) is a fundamental resource that has been argued to be a key driver of linguistic expressiveness. As such, it plays a central role in fundamental debates on what makes human language unique, and how they might have evolved. Empirical evidence on the prevalence and the limits of embeddings has however been based on either laboratory setups or corpus data of relatively limited size. We introduce here a collection of large, dependency-parsed written corpora in 17 languages, that allow us, for the first time, to capture clausal embedding through dependency graphs and assess their distribution. Our results indicate that there is no evidence for hard constraints on embedding depth: the tail of depth distributions is heavy. Moreover, although deeply embedded clauses tend to be shorter, suggesting processing load issues, complex sentences with many embeddings do not display a bias towards less deep embeddings. Taken together, the results suggest that deep embeddings are not disfavoured in written language. More generally, our study illustrates how resources and methods from latest-generation big-data NLP can provide new perspectives on fundamental questions in theoretical linguistics.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1384,,On the Distribution of Deep Clausal Embeddings: A Large Cross-linguistic Study,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1384/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Specifically, we linearize parse trees of source sentences to obtain structural label sequences. On the basis, we propose three different sorts of encoders to incorporate source syntax into NMT: 1) Parallel RNN encoder that learns word and label annotation vectors parallelly; 2) Hierarchical RNN encoder that learns word and label annotation vectors in a two-level hierarchy; and 3) Mixed RNN encoder that stitchingly learns word and label annotation vectors over sequences where words and labels are mixed. Experimentation on Chinese-to-English translation demonstrates that all the three proposed syntactic encoders are able to improve translation accuracy. It is interesting to note that the simplest RNN encoder, i.e., Mixed RNN encoder yields the best performance with an significant improvement of 1.4 BLEU points.

We describe a solution based on attending an ensemble of domain experts. We assume K domain specific intent and slot models trained on respective domains.

To facilitate the development of such conversation systems, we create a new dataset named Konv where one acts as a conversation leader and the other acts as the follower. The leader is provided with a knowledge graph and asked to sequentially change the discussion topics, following the given conversation goal, and meanwhile keep the dialogue as natural and engaging as possible. Konv enables a very challenging task as the model needs to both understand dialogue and plan over the given knowledge graph.

Some researchers try to use the cosine similarity or the traditional attention mechanism to find the relevant contexts, but they suffer from either insufficient relevance assumption or position bias problem. In this paper, we propose a new model, named ReCoSa, to tackle this problem. Firstly, a word level LSTM encoder is conducted to obtain the initial representation of each context. Then, the self-attention mechanism is utilized to update both the context and masked response representation. Finally, the attention weights between each context and response representations are computed and used in the further decoding process. Experimental results on both Chinese customer services dataset and English Ubuntu dialogue dataset show that ReCoSa significantly outperforms baseline models, in terms of both metric-based and human evaluations.

Yet it remains an elusive, poorly measured construct. Recent research draws on computational linguistics to measure cultural fit but overlooks asymmetries in cultural adaptation. By contrast, we develop a directed, dynamic measure of cultural fit based on linguistic alignment, which estimates the influence of one person’s word use on another’s and distinguishes between two enculturation mechanisms: internalization and self-regulation. We use this measure to trace employees’ enculturation trajectories over a large, multi-year corpus of corporate emails and find that patterns of alignment in the first six months of employment are predictive of individuals’ downstream outcomes, especially involuntary exit. Further predictive analyses suggest referential alignment plays an overlooked role in linguistic alignment.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1056,,Alignment at Work: Using Language to Distinguish the Internalization and Self-Regulation Components of Cultural Fit in Organizations,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P17/P17-1056/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

These approaches could neither identify keyphrases that do not appear in the text, nor capture the real semantic meaning behind the text. We propose a generative model for keyphrase prediction with an encoder-decoder framework, which can effectively overcome the above drawbacks. We name it as deep keyphrase generation since it attempts to capture the deep semantic meaning of the content with a deep learning method. Empirical analysis on six datasets demonstrates that our proposed model not only achieves a significant performance boost on extracting keyphrases that appear in the source text, but also can generate absent keyphrases based on the semantic meaning of the text.

In the literature, several deep and complex neural networks have been proposed for this task, assuming availability of relatively large amounts of training data. However, the associated computational complexity increases as the networks go deeper, which poses serious challenges in practical applications. Moreover, it was shown recently that shallow word-level CNNs are more accurate and much faster than the state-of-the-art very deep nets such as character-level CNNs even in the setting of large training data. Motivated by these findings, we carefully studied deepening of word-level CNNs to capture global representations of text, and found a simple network architecture with which the best accuracy can be obtained by increasing the network depth without increasing computational cost by much. We call it deep pyramid CNN.

Specifically, we automatically reconstruct phylogenetic language trees from monolingual texts (translated from several source languages).

This paper proposes joint decoding algorithm for end-to-end ASR with a hybrid CTC/attention architecture, which effectively utilizes both advantages in decoding.

Such goal-oriented dialogue agents typically need to interact with an external database to access real-world knowledge. Previous systems achieved this by issuing a symbolic query to the KB to retrieve entries based on their attributes. However, such symbolic operations break the differentiability of the system and prevent end-to-end training of neural dialogue agents. In this paper, we address this limitation by replacing symbolic queries with an induced “soft” posterior distribution over the KB that indicates which entities the user is interested in. Integrating the soft retrieval process with a reinforcement learner leads to higher task success rate and reward in both simulations and against real users. We also present a fully neural end-to-end agent, trained entirely from user feedback, and discuss its application towards personalized dialogue agents.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1045,,Towards End-to-End Reinforcement Learning of Dialogue Agents for Information Access,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P17/P17-1045/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

We analyze the time expressions from four datasets and find that only a small group of words are used to express time information, and the words in time expressions demonstrate similar syntactic behaviour.

Specifically, we define three main syntactic token types, namely time token, modifier, and numeral, to group time-related regular expressions over tokens. On the types we design general heuristic rules to recognize time expressions. In recognition, SynTime first identifies the time tokens from raw text, then searches their surroundings for modifiers and numerals to form time segments, and finally merges the time segments to time expressions. As a light-weight rule-based tagger, SynTime runs in real time, and can be easily expanded by simply adding keywords for the text of different types and of different domains.

The idea is to replace carefully selected subtrees of constituency parses of sentences in the resource-rich language with suitable token spans selected from automatic translations to the resource-poor language. By augmenting the scarce labeled code-switched text with plentiful synthetic labeled code-switched text, we achieve significant improvements in sentiment labeling accuracy (1.5%, 5.11% 7.20%) for three different language pairs (English-Hindi, English-Spanish and English-Bengali).

Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers),https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P17-1/,2017,"AbstractModern models of event extraction for tasks like ACE are based on supervised learning of events from small hand-labeled data. However, hand-labeled training data is expensive to produce, in low coverage of event types, and limited in size, which makes supervised methods hard to extract large scale of events for knowledge base population. To solve the data labeling problem, we propose to automatically label training data for event extraction via world knowledge and linguistic knowledge, which can detect key arguments and trigger words for each event type and employ them to label events in texts automatically. The experimental results show that the quality of our large scale automatically labeled data is competitive with elaborately human-labeled data. And our automatically labeled data can incorporate with human-labeled data, then improve the performance of models learned from these data.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1038,,Automatically Labeled Data Generation for Large Scale Event Extraction,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P17/P17-1038/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

In this paper, we present a novel neural approach with the aim of discovering coherent aspects. The model improves coherence by exploiting the distribution of word co-occurrences through the use of neural word embeddings. Unlike topic models which typically assume independently generated words, word embedding models encourage words that appear in similar contexts to be located close to each other in the embedding space. In addition, we use an attention mechanism to de-emphasize irrelevant words during training, further improving the coherence of aspects. Experimental results on real-life datasets demonstrate that our approach discovers more meaningful and coherent aspects, and substantially outperforms baseline methods on several evaluation tasks.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1036,,An Unsupervised Neural Attention Model for Aspect Extraction,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P17/P17-1036/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

We contend that manual extraction of features may not be the best way to tackle text subtleties that characteristically prevail in complex classification tasks like Sentiment Analysis and Sarcasm Detection, and that even the extraction and choice of features should be delegated to the learning system. We introduce a framework to automatically extract cognitive features from the eye-movement/gaze data of human readers reading the text and use them as features along with textual features for the tasks of sentiment polarity and sarcasm detection. Our proposed framework is based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN learns features from both gaze and text and uses them to classify the input text. We test our technique on published sentiment and sarcasm labeled datasets, enriched with gaze information, to show that using a combination of automatically learned text and gaze features often yields better classification performance over (i) CNN based systems that rely on text input alone and (ii) existing systems that rely on handcrafted gaze and textual features.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1035,,Learning Cognitive Features from Gaze Data for Sentiment and Sarcasm Classification using Convolutional Neural Network,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P17/P17-1035/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

This kind of knowledge is useful not only for stance detection across multiple topics but also for various real-world applications including public opinion survey, electoral prediction, electoral campaigns, and online debates. In order to extract users’ preferences on Twitter, we design linguistic patterns in which people agree and disagree about specific topics (e.g., “A is completely wrong”). By applying these linguistic patterns to a collection of tweets, we extract statements agreeing and disagreeing with various topics. Inspired by previous work on item recommendation, we formalize the task of modeling inter-topic preferences as matrix factorization: representing users’ preference as a user-topic matrix and mapping both users and topics onto a latent feature space that abstracts the preferences. Our experimental results demonstrate both that our presented approach is useful in predicting missing preferences of users and that the latent vector representations of topics successfully encode inter-topic preferences.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1037,,Other Topics You May Also Agree or Disagree: Modeling Inter-Topic Preferences using Tweets and Matrix Factorization,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P17/P17-1037/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

We present a model that learns individual predictors for object names that link visual and distributional aspects of word meaning during training. We show that this is particularly beneficial for zero-shot learning, as compared to projecting visual objects directly into the distributional space.

We also find that pre-training is beneficial across all 11 languages tested; however, large model sizes (more than 100 million parameters) make it computationally expensive to train separate models for each language. To address this shortcoming, we show that joint multilingual pre-training and fine-tuning allows sharing all but a small number of parameters between ten languages in the final model. The 10x reduction in model size compared to fine-tuning one model per language causes only a 3.2% relative error increase in aggregate. We further explore the idea of joint fine-tuning and show that it gives low-resource languages a way to benefit from the larger datasets of other languages.

Also, their model lacks interpretability as it is not grounded in parsing actions. In our work, we propose an imitation learning approach to unsupervised parsing, where we transfer the syntactic knowledge induced by PRPN to a Tree-LSTM model with discrete parsing actions. Its policy is then refined by Gumbel-Softmax training towards a semantically oriented objective. We evaluate our approach on the All Natural Language Inference dataset and show that it achieves a new state of the art in terms of parsing F-score, outperforming our base models, including PRPN.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1338,,An Imitation Learning Approach to Unsupervised Parsing,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1338/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Specifically, two variants of DATNet, i.e., DATNet-F and DATNet-P, are investigated to explore effective feature fusion between high and low resource. To address the noisy and imbalanced training data, we propose a novel Generalized Resource-Adversarial Discriminator (GRAD). Additionally, adversarial training is adopted to boost model generalization. In experiments, we examine the effects of different components in DATNet across domains and languages and show that significant improvement can be obtained especially for low-resource data, without augmenting any additional hand-crafted features and pre-trained language model.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1336,,Dual Adversarial Neural Transfer for Low-Resource Named Entity Recognition,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1336/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractPrior work has shown that, on small amounts of training data, syntactic neural language models learn structurally sensitive generalisations more successfully than sequential language models. However, their computational complexity renders scaling difficult, and it remains an open question whether structural biases are still necessary when sequential models have access to ever larger amounts of training data. To answer this question, we introduce an efficient knowledge distillation (KD) technique that transfers knowledge from a syntactic language model trained on a small corpus to an LSTM language model, hence enabling the LSTM to develop a more structurally sensitive representation of the larger training data it learns from. On targeted syntactic evaluations, we find that, while sequential LSTMs perform much better than previously reported, our proposed technique substantially improves on this baseline, yielding a new state of the art. Our findings and analysis affirm the importance of structural biases, even in models that learn from large amounts of data.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1337,,Scalable Syntax-Aware Language Models Using Knowledge Distillation,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1337/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractWe present an approach for recursively splitting and rephrasing complex English sentences into a novel semantic hierarchy of simplified sentences, with each of them presenting a more regular structure that may facilitate a wide variety of artificial intelligence tasks, such as machine translation (MT) or information extraction (IE). Using a set of hand-crafted transformation rules, input sentences are recursively transformed into a two-layered hierarchical representation in the form of core sentences and accompanying contexts that are linked via rhetorical relations. In this way, the semantic relationship of the decomposed constituents is preserved in the output, maintaining its interpretability for downstream applications. Both a thorough manual analysis and automatic evaluation across three datasets from two different domains demonstrate that the proposed syntactic simplification approach outperforms the state of the art in structural text simplification. Moreover, an extrinsic evaluation shows that when applying our framework as a preprocessing step the performance of state-of-the-art Open IE systems can be improved by up to 346% in precision and 52% in recall.

We study this issue within natural language inference (NLI), the task of determining whether one sentence entails another. We hypothesize that statistical NLI models may adopt three fallible syntactic heuristics: the lexical overlap heuristic, the subsequence heuristic, and the constituent heuristic. To determine whether models have adopted these heuristics, we introduce a controlled evaluation set called HANS (Heuristic Analysis for NLI Systems), which contains many examples where the heuristics fail. We find that models trained on MNLI, including BERT, a state-of-the-art model, perform very poorly on HANS, suggesting that they have indeed adopted these heuristics. We conclude that there is substantial room for improvement in NLI systems, and that the HANS dataset can motivate and measure progress in this area.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1334,,Right for the Wrong Reasons: Diagnosing Syntactic Heuristics in Natural Language Inference,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1334/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Specifically, the model is composed of multiple encoders and decoders with different structures, each of which corresponds to a specific granularity. The empirical study shows that the decomposition mechanism of DNPG makes paraphrase generation more interpretable and controllable.

Most current neural sentence simplification systems are variants of sequence-to-sequence models adopted from machine translation.

By contrast, our neural programmer-interpreter is directly trained to predict explicit edit operations on targeted parts of the input sentence, resembling the way that humans perform simplification and revision. Our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art neural sentence simplification models (without external knowledge) by large margins on three benchmark text simplification corpora in terms of SARI (+0.95 WikiLarge, +1.89 WikiSmall, +1.41 Newsela), and is judged by humans to produce overall better and simpler output sentences.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1331,,EditNTS: An Neural Programmer-Interpreter Model for Sentence Simplification through Explicit Editing,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1331/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

However, manual evaluation of the system generated summaries is inconsistent due to the difficulty the task poses to human non-expert readers. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach for manual evaluation, Highlight-based Reference-less Evaluation of Summarization (HighRES), in which summaries are assessed by multiple annotators against the source document via manually highlighted salient content in the latter. Thus summary assessment on the source document by human judges is facilitated, while the highlights can be used for evaluating multiple systems. To validate our approach we employ crowd-workers to augment with highlights a recently proposed dataset and compare two state-of-the-art systems. We demonstrate that HighRES improves inter-annotator agreement in comparison to using the source document directly, while they help emphasize differences among systems that would be ignored under other evaluation approaches.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1330,,HighRES: Highlight-based Reference-less Evaluation of Summarization,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1330/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

In this work, we show that existing embedding models are inadequate at constructing representations that capture salient aspects of mathematical meaning for numbers, which is important for language understanding.

Inspired by cognitive studies on how humans perceive numbers, we develop an analysis framework to test how well word embeddings capture two essential properties of numbers: magnitude (e.g. 3<4) and numeration (e.g. 3=three). Our experiments reveal that most models capture an approximate notion of magnitude, but are inadequate at capturing numeration.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractPrevious studies on lexical substitution tend to obtain substitute candidates by finding the target word’s synonyms from lexical resources (e.g., WordNet) and then rank the candidates based on its contexts. These approaches have two limitations: (1) They are likely to overlook good substitute candidates that are not the synonyms of the target words in the lexical resources; (2) They fail to take into account the substitution’s influence on the global context of the sentence. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end BERT-based lexical substitution approach which can propose and validate substitute candidates without using any annotated data or manually curated resources. Our approach first applies dropout to the target word’s embedding for partially masking the word, allowing BERT to take balanced consideration of the target word’s semantics and contexts for proposing substitute candidates, and then validates the candidates based on their substitution’s influence on the global contextualized representation of the sentence. Experiments show our approach performs well in both proposing and ranking substitute candidates, achieving the state-of-the-art results in both LS07 and LS14 benchmarks.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1328,,BERT-based Lexical Substitution,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1328/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Embedding imputation involves learning representations for rare or unseen words during the training of an embedding model, often in a post-hoc manner. In this paper, we propose an approach for embedding imputation which uses grounded information in the form of a knowledge graph. This is in contrast to existing approaches which typically make use of vector space properties or subword information. We propose an online method to construct a graph from grounded information and design an algorithm to map from the resulting graphical structure to the space of the pre-trained embeddings. Finally, we evaluate our approach on a range of rare and unseen word tasks across various domains and show that our model can learn better representations.

Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers),https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P17-1/,2017,"AbstractGenerating answer with natural language sentence is very important in real-world question answering systems, which needs to obtain a right answer as well as a coherent natural response. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end question answering system called COREQA in sequence-to-sequence learning, which incorporates copying and retrieving mechanisms to generate natural answers within an encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, in COREQA, the semantic units (words, phrases and entities) in a natural answer are dynamically predicted from the vocabulary, copied from the given question and/or retrieved from the corresponding knowledge base jointly. Our empirical study on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates the efficiency of COREQA, which is able to generate correct, coherent and natural answers for knowledge inquired questions.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1019,,Generating Natural Answers by Incorporating Copying and Retrieving Mechanisms in Sequence-to-Sequence Learning,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P17/P17-1019/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers),https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P17-1/,2017,"AbstractWe present a framework for question answering that can efficiently scale to longer documents while maintaining or even improving performance of state-of-the-art models. While most successful approaches for reading comprehension rely on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), running them over long documents is prohibitively slow because it is difficult to parallelize over sequences. Inspired by how people first skim the document, identify relevant parts, and carefully read these parts to produce an answer, we combine a coarse, fast model for selecting relevant sentences and a more expensive RNN for producing the answer from those sentences. We treat sentence selection as a latent variable trained jointly from the answer only using reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on a challenging subset of the WikiReading dataset and on a new dataset, while speeding up the model by 3.5x-6.7x.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1020,,Coarse-to-Fine Question Answering for Long Documents,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P17/P17-1020/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers),https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P17-1/,2017,"AbstractIn this paper, we present the gated self-matching networks for reading comprehension style question answering, which aims to answer questions from a given passage. We first match the question and passage with gated attention-based recurrent networks to obtain the question-aware passage representation. Then we propose a self-matching attention mechanism to refine the representation by matching the passage against itself, which effectively encodes information from the whole passage. We finally employ the pointer networks to locate the positions of answers from the passages. We conduct extensive experiments on the SQuAD dataset. The single model achieves 71.3% on the evaluation metrics of exact match on the hidden test set, while the ensemble model further boosts the results to 75.9%. At the time of submission of the paper, our model holds the first place on the SQuAD leaderboard for both single and ensemble model.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1018,,Gated Self-Matching Networks for Reading Comprehension and Question Answering,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P17/P17-1018/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers),https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P17-1/,2017,"AbstractWe propose two novel methodologies for the automatic generation of rhythmic poetry in a variety of forms. The first approach uses a neural language model trained on a phonetic encoding to learn an implicit representation of both the form and content of English poetry. This model can effectively learn common poetic devices such as rhyme, rhythm and alliteration.

Because our method pairs data of varying size and shape with texts ranging from simple clauses to short texts, a dataset created using this framework provides a challenging benchmark for microplanning. Another feature of this framework is that it can be applied to any large scale knowledge base and can therefore be used to train and learn KB verbalisers. We apply our framework to DBpedia data and compare the resulting dataset with Wen et al. 2016’s. We show that while Wen et al.’s dataset is more than twice larger than ours, it is less diverse both in terms of input and in terms of text. We thus propose our corpus generation framework as a novel method for creating challenging data sets from which NLG models can be learned which are capable of handling the complex interactions occurring during in micro-planning between lexicalisation, aggregation, surface realisation, referring expression generation and sentence segmentation.

Although rationales do not explicitly specify programs, they provide a scaffolding for their structure via intermediate milestones.

Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers),https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P17-1/,2017,"AbstractIn recent years word-embedding models have gained great popularity due to their remarkable performance on several tasks, including word analogy questions and caption generation. An unexpected “side-effect” of such models is that their vectors often exhibit compositionality, i.e., adding two word-vectors results in a vector that is only a small angle away from the vector of a word representing the semantic composite of the original words, e.g., “man” + “royal” = “king”. This work provides a theoretical justification for the presence of additive compositionality in word vectors learned using the Skip-Gram model. In particular, it shows that additive compositionality holds in an even stricter sense (small distance rather than small angle) under certain assumptions on the process generating the corpus. As a corollary, it explains the success of vector calculus in solving word analogies. When these assumptions do not hold, this work describes the correct non-linear composition operator. Finally, this work establishes a connection between the Skip-Gram model and the Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction (SDR) framework of Globerson and Tishby: the parameters of SDR models can be obtained from those of Skip-Gram models simply by adding information on symbol frequencies. This shows that Skip-Gram embeddings are optimal in the sense of Globerson and Tishby and, further, implies that the heuristics commonly used to approximately fit Skip-Gram models can be used to fit SDR models.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1007,,Skip-Gram − Zipf + Uniform = Vector Additivity,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P17/P17-1007/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

In this work, we propose a novel morph-fitting procedure which moves past the use of curated semantic lexicons for improving distributional vector spaces. Instead, our method injects morphological constraints generated using simple language-specific rules, pulling inflectional forms of the same word close together and pushing derivational antonyms far apart. In intrinsic evaluation over four languages, we show that our approach: 1) improves low-frequency word estimates; and 2) boosts the semantic quality of the entire word vector collection.

However, the words from a given language can be organized in various natural groupings, such as syntactic word classes (e.g. nouns, adjectives, verbs) and semantic themes (e.g. sports, politics, sentiment). Our hypothesis in this paper is that embedding models can be improved by explicitly imposing a cluster structure on the set of context word vectors. To this end, our model relies on the assumption that context word vectors are drawn from a mixture of von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions, where the parameters of this mixture distribution are jointly optimized with the word vectors.

This approach allows us to set appropriate constraints for inferring concept hierarchies from distributional contexts while also being able to predict missing “is-a”-relationships and to correct wrong extractions. Moreover – and in contrast with other methods – the hierarchical nature of hyperbolic space allows us to learn highly efficient representations and to improve the taxonomic consistency of the inferred hierarchies. Experimentally, we show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several commonly-used benchmarks.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1313,,Inferring Concept Hierarchies from Text Corpora via Hyperbolic Embeddings,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1313/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractCross-lingual transfer is an effective way to build syntactic analysis tools in low-resource languages. However, transfer is difficult when transferring to typologically distant languages, especially when neither annotated target data nor parallel corpora are available. In this paper, we focus on methods for cross-lingual transfer to distant languages and propose to learn a generative model with a structured prior that utilizes labeled source data and unlabeled target data jointly. The parameters of source model and target model are softly shared through a regularized log likelihood objective. An invertible projection is employed to learn a new interlingual latent embedding space that compensates for imperfect cross-lingual word embedding input. We evaluate our method on two syntactic tasks: part-of-speech (POS) tagging and dependency parsing. On the Universal Dependency Treebanks, we use English as the only source corpus and transfer to a wide range of target languages. On the 10 languages in this dataset that are distant from English, our method yields an average of 5.2% absolute improvement on POS tagging and 8.3% absolute improvement on dependency parsing over a direct transfer method using state-of-the-art discriminative models.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1311,,Cross-Lingual Syntactic Transfer through Unsupervised Adaptation of Invertible Projections,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1311/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractMachine translation is highly sensitive to the size and quality of the training data, which has led to an increasing interest in collecting and filtering large parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a new method for this task based on multilingual sentence embeddings. In contrast to previous approaches, which rely on nearest neighbor retrieval with a hard threshold over cosine similarity, our proposed method accounts for the scale inconsistencies of this measure, considering the margin between a given sentence pair and its closest candidates instead. Our experiments show large improvements over existing methods. We outperform the best published results on the BUCC mining task and the UN reconstruction task by more than 10 F1 and 30 precision points, respectively.

Previous work has shown that morphological variation is an intractable challenge for the UBLI task, where the induced translation in failure case is usually morphologically related to the correct translation. To tackle this challenge, we propose a morphology-aware alignment model for the UBLI task. The proposed model aims to alleviate the adverse effect of morphological variation by introducing grammatical information learned by the pre-trained denoising language model.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractCross-lingual word embeddings (CLWE) underlie many multilingual natural language processing systems, often through orthogonal transformations of pre-trained monolingual embeddings. However, orthogonal mapping only works on language pairs whose embeddings are naturally isomorphic. For non-isomorphic pairs, our method (Iterative Normalization) transforms monolingual embeddings to make orthogonal alignment easier by simultaneously enforcing that (1) individual word vectors are unit length, and (2) each language’s average vector is zero. Iterative Normalization consistently improves word translation accuracy of three CLWE methods, with the largest improvement observed on English-Japanese (from 2% to 44% test accuracy).",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1307,,Are Girls Neko or Shōjo?

We match queries and documents in both source and target languages with four components, each of which is implemented as a term interaction-based deep neural network with cross-lingual word embeddings as input. By including query likelihood scores as extra features, our model effectively learns to rerank the retrieved documents by using a small number of relevance labels for low-resource language pairs. Due to the shared cross-lingual word embedding space, the model can also be directly applied to another language pair without any training label. Experimental results on the Material dataset show that our model outperforms the competitive translation-based baselines on English-Swahili, English-Tagalog, and English-Somali cross-lingual information retrieval tasks.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1306,,Improving Low-Resource Cross-lingual Document Retrieval by Reranking with Deep Bilingual Representations,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1306/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractAbstractive Sentence Summarization (ASSUM) targets at grasping the core idea of the source sentence and presenting it as the summary. It is extensively studied using statistical models or neural models based on the large-scale monolingual source-summary parallel corpus. But there is no cross-lingual parallel corpus, whose source sentence language is different to the summary language, to directly train a cross-lingual ASSUM system. We propose to solve this zero-shot problem by using resource-rich monolingual ASSUM system to teach zero-shot cross-lingual ASSUM system on both summary word generation and attention. This teaching process is along with a back-translation process which simulates source-summary pairs. Experiments on cross-lingual ASSUM task show that our proposed method is significantly better than pipeline baselines and previous works, and greatly enhances the cross-lingual performances closer to the monolingual performances.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1305,,Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Abstractive Sentence Summarization through Teaching Generation and Attention,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1305/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

From this view, the KB-alignment task can be formulated as a graph matching problem; and we further propose a graph-attention based solution, which first matches all entities in two topic entity graphs, and then jointly model the local matching information to derive a graph-level matching vector.

To effectively train the model in unsupervised manner, we innovate the training procedure by formalizing it as a minimum-cost flow problem. When applied to decipherment of Ugaritic, we achieve 5% absolute improvement over state-of-the-art results.

However, given a particular task language, it is not clear which language to transfer from, and the standard strategy is to select languages based on ad hoc criteria, usually the intuition of the experimenter. Since a large number of features contribute to the success of cross-lingual transfer (including phylogenetic similarity, typological properties, lexical overlap, or size of available data), even the most enlightened experimenter rarely considers all these factors for the particular task at hand. In this paper, we consider this task of automatically selecting optimal transfer languages as a ranking problem, and build models that consider the aforementioned features to perform this prediction. In experiments on representative NLP tasks, we demonstrate that our model predicts good transfer languages much better than ad hoc baselines considering single features in isolation, and glean insights on what features are most informative for each different NLP tasks, which may inform future ad hoc selection even without use of our method.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1301,,Choosing Transfer Languages for Cross-Lingual Learning,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1301/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractRecently, a variety of unsupervised methods have been proposed that map pre-trained word embeddings of different languages into the same space without any parallel data. These methods aim to find a linear transformation based on the assumption that monolingual word embeddings are approximately isomorphic between languages. However, it has been demonstrated that this assumption holds true only on specific conditions, and with limited resources, the performance of these methods decreases drastically. To overcome this problem, we propose a new unsupervised multilingual embedding method that does not rely on such assumption and performs well under resource-poor scenarios, namely when only a small amount of monolingual data (i.e., 50k sentences) are available, or when the domains of monolingual data are different across languages. Our proposed model, which we call ‘Multilingual Neural Language Models’, shares some of the network parameters among multiple languages, and encodes sentences of multiple languages into the same space. The model jointly learns word embeddings of different languages in the same space, and generates multilingual embeddings without any parallel data or pre-training. Our experiments on word alignment tasks have demonstrated that, on the low-resource condition, our model substantially outperforms existing unsupervised and even supervised methods trained with 500 bilingual pairs of words.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractModern NLP applications have enjoyed a great boost utilizing neural networks models. Such deep neural models, however, are not applicable to most human languages due to the lack of annotated training data for various NLP tasks. Cross-lingual transfer learning (CLTL) is a viable method for building NLP models for a low-resource target language by leveraging labeled data from other (source) languages. In this work, we focus on the multilingual transfer setting where training data in multiple source languages is leveraged to further boost target language performance. Unlike most existing methods that rely only on language-invariant features for CLTL, our approach coherently utilizes both language-invariant and language-specific features at instance level. Our model leverages adversarial networks to learn language-invariant features, and mixture-of-experts models to dynamically exploit the similarity between the target language and each individual source language. This enables our model to learn effectively what to share between various languages in the multilingual setup. Moreover, when coupled with unsupervised multilingual embeddings, our model can operate in a zero-resource setting where neither target language training data nor cross-lingual resources are available. Our model achieves significant performance gains over prior art, as shown in an extensive set of experiments over multiple text classification and sequence tagging tasks including a large-scale industry dataset.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1299,,Multi-Source Cross-Lingual Model Transfer: Learning What to Share,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1299/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

To integrate different segmentations with the state-of-the-art NMT model, Transformer, we propose lattice-based encoders to explore effective word or subword representation in an automatic way during training.

We build our Translationese decoder once from a mish-mash of parallel data that has the target language in common and then can build dictionaries on demand using unsupervised techniques, resulting in rapidly generated unsupervised neural MT systems for many source languages.

To address this argument, we propose a hybrid attention mechanism to dynamically leverage both of the local and global information. Specifically, our approach uses a gating scalar for integrating both sources of the information, which is also convenient for quantifying their contributions.

While we observe some ways in which higher attention weights correlate with greater impact on model predictions, we also find many ways in which this does not hold, i.e., where gradient-based rankings of attention weights better predict their effects than their magnitudes. We conclude that while attention noisily predicts input components’ overall importance to a model, it is by no means a fail-safe indicator.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1282,,Is Attention Interpretable?,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1282/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractWe present FIESTA, a model selection approach that significantly reduces the computational resources required to reliably identify state-of-the-art performance from large collections of candidate models. Despite being known to produce unreliable comparisons, it is still common practice to compare model evaluations based on single choices of random seeds. We show that reliable model selection also requires evaluations based on multiple train-test splits (contrary to common practice in many shared tasks). Using bandit theory from the statistics literature, we are able to adaptively determine appropriate numbers of data splits and random seeds used to evaluate each model, focusing computational resources on the evaluation of promising models whilst avoiding wasting evaluations on models with lower performance. Furthermore, our user-friendly Python implementation produces confidence guarantees of correctly selecting the optimal model. We evaluate our algorithms by selecting between 8 target-dependent sentiment analysis methods using dramatically fewer model evaluations than current model selection approaches.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1281,,FIESTA: Fast IdEntification of State-of-The-Art models using adaptive bandit algorithms,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1281/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractGeneral purpose relation extractors, which can model arbitrary relations, are a core aspiration in information extraction. Efforts have been made to build general purpose extractors that represent relations with their surface forms, or which jointly embed surface forms with relations from an existing knowledge graph. However, both of these approaches are limited in their ability to generalize. In this paper, we build on extensions of Harris’ distributional hypothesis to relations, as well as recent advances in learning text representations (specifically, BERT), to build task agnostic relation representations solely from entity-linked text. We show that these representations significantly outperform previous work on exemplar based relation extraction (FewRel) even without using any of that task’s training data. We also show that models initialized with our task agnostic representations, and then tuned on supervised relation extraction datasets, significantly outperform the previous methods on SemEval 2010 Task 8, KBP37, and TACRED",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1279,,Matching the Blanks: Distributional Similarity for Relation Learning,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1279/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Proper DNN comparison hence requires a comparison between their empirical score distributions on unseen data, rather than between single evaluation scores as is standard for more simple, convex models. In this paper, we propose to adapt to this problem a recently proposed test for the Almost Stochastic Dominance relation between two distributions. We define the criteria for a high quality comparison method between DNNs, and show, both theoretically and through analysis of extensive experimental results with leading DNN models for sequence tagging tasks, that the proposed test meets all criteria while previously proposed methods fail to do so.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractWe propose a novel, path-based reasoning approach for the multi-hop reading comprehension task where a system needs to combine facts from multiple passages to answer a question. Although inspired by multi-hop reasoning over knowledge graphs, our proposed approach operates directly over unstructured text. It generates potential paths through passages and scores them without any direct path supervision. The proposed model, named PathNet, attempts to extract implicit relations from text through entity pair representations, and compose them to encode each path. To capture additional context, PathNet also composes the passage representations along each path to compute a passage-based representation. Unlike previous approaches, our model is then able to explain its reasoning via these explicit paths through the passages. We show that our approach outperforms prior models on the multi-hop Wikihop dataset, and also can be generalized to apply to the OpenBookQA dataset, matching state-of-the-art performance.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1263,,Exploiting Explicit Paths for Multi-hop Reading Comprehension,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1263/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractMulti-hop question answering requires a model to connect multiple pieces of evidence scattered in a long context to answer the question. In this paper, we show that in the multi-hop HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018) dataset, the examples often contain reasoning shortcuts through which models can directly locate the answer by word-matching the question with a sentence in the context. We demonstrate this issue by constructing adversarial documents that create contradicting answers to the shortcut but do not affect the validity of the original answer. The performance of strong baseline models drops significantly on our adversarial test, indicating that they are indeed exploiting the shortcuts rather than performing multi-hop reasoning. After adversarial training, the baseline’s performance improves but is still limited on the adversarial test. Hence, we use a control unit that dynamically attends to the question at different reasoning hops to guide the model’s multi-hop reasoning. We show that our 2-hop model trained on the regular data is more robust to the adversaries than the baseline. After adversarial training, it not only achieves significant improvements over its counterpart trained on regular data, but also outperforms the adversarially-trained baseline significantly. Finally, we sanity-check that these improvements are not obtained by exploiting potential new shortcuts in the adversarial data, but indeed due to robust multi-hop reasoning skills of the models.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1262,,"Avoiding Reasoning Shortcuts: Adversarial Evaluation, Training, and Model Development for Multi-Hop QA",https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1262/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractMulti-hop reading comprehension requires the model to explore and connect relevant information from multiple sentences/documents in order to answer the question about the context.

First, the Document Explorer iteratively selects relevant documents and represents divergent reasoning chains in a tree structure so as to allow assimilating information from all chains. The Answer Proposer then proposes an answer from every root-to-leaf path in the reasoning tree. Finally, the Evidence Assembler extracts a key sentence containing the proposed answer from every path and combines them to predict the final answer. Intuitively, EPAr approximates the coarse-to-fine-grained comprehension behavior of human readers when facing multiple long documents. We jointly optimize our 3 modules by minimizing the sum of losses from each stage conditioned on the previous stage’s output.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractMulti-hop reading comprehension (RC) across documents poses new challenge over single-document RC because it requires reasoning over multiple documents to reach the final answer. In this paper, we propose a new model to tackle the multi-hop RC problem. We introduce a heterogeneous graph with different types of nodes and edges, which is named as Heterogeneous Document-Entity (HDE) graph. The advantage of HDE graph is that it contains different granularity levels of information including candidates, documents and entities in specific document contexts. Our proposed model can do reasoning over the HDE graph with nodes representation initialized with co-attention and self-attention based context encoders. We employ Graph Neural Networks (GNN) based message passing algorithms to accumulate evidences on the proposed HDE graph. Evaluated on the blind test set of the Qangaroo WikiHop data set, our HDE graph based single model delivers competitive result, and the ensemble model achieves the state-of-the-art performance.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1260,,Multi-hop Reading Comprehension across Multiple Documents by Reasoning over Heterogeneous Graphs,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1260/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractWe propose a new CogQA framework for multi-hop reading comprehension question answering in web-scale documents. Founded on the dual process theory in cognitive science, the framework gradually builds a cognitive graph in an iterative process by coordinating an implicit extraction module (System 1) and an explicit reasoning module (System 2). While giving accurate answers, our framework further provides explainable reasoning paths. Specifically, our implementation based on BERT and graph neural network efficiently handles millions of documents for multi-hop reasoning questions in the HotpotQA fullwiki dataset, achieving a winning joint F1 score of 34.9 on the leaderboard, compared to 23.1 of the best competitor.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1259,,Cognitive Graph for Multi-Hop Reading Comprehension at Scale,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1259/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractRecently, to incorporate external Knowledge Base (KB) information, one form of world knowledge, several end-to-end task-oriented dialog systems have been proposed. These models, however, tend to confound the dialog history with KB tuples and simply store them into one memory. Inspired by the psychological studies on working memory, we propose a working memory model (WMM2Seq) for dialog response generation. Our WMM2Seq adopts a working memory to interact with two separated long-term memories, which are the episodic memory for memorizing dialog history and the semantic memory for storing KB tuples. The working memory consists of a central executive to attend to the aforementioned memories, and a short-term storage system to store the “activated” contents from the long-term memories. Furthermore, we introduce a context-sensitive perceptual process for the token representations of dialog history, and then feed them into the episodic memory. Extensive experiments on two task-oriented dialog datasets demonstrate that our WMM2Seq significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art results in several evaluation metrics.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1258,,A Working Memory Model for Task-oriented Dialog Response Generation,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1258/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractRecent neural language generation systems often hallucinate contents (i.e., producing irrelevant or contradicted facts), especially when trained on loosely corresponding pairs of the input structure and text. To mitigate this issue, we propose to integrate a language understanding module for data refinement with self-training iterations to effectively induce strong equivalence between the input data and the paired text. Experiments on the E2E challenge dataset show that our proposed framework can reduce more than 50% relative unaligned noise from the original data-text pairs. A vanilla sequence-to-sequence neural NLG model trained on the refined data has improved on content correctness compared with the current state-of-the-art ensemble generator.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1256,,A Simple Recipe towards Reducing Hallucination in Neural Surface Realisation,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1256/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

For instance, graphic news contains plenty of images in addition to text. Contents other than text are also vital because they are not only more attractive to the reader but also may provide critical information. To remedy this, we propose a new task: cross-model automatic commenting (CMAC), which aims to make comments by integrating multiple modal contents. We construct a large-scale dataset for this task and explore several representative methods. Going a step further, an effective co-attention model is presented to capture the dependency between textual and visual information. Evaluation results show that our proposed model can achieve better performance than competitive baselines.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1257,,Cross-Modal Commentator: Automatic Machine Commenting Based on Cross-Modal Information,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1257/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractAutomatic argument generation is an appealing but challenging task. In this paper, we study the specific problem of counter-argument generation, and present a novel framework, CANDELA. It consists of a powerful retrieval system and a novel two-step generation model, where a text planning decoder first decides on the main talking points and a proper language style for each sentence, then a content realization decoder reflects the decisions and constructs an informative paragraph-level argument. Furthermore, our generation model is empowered by a retrieval system indexed with 12 million articles collected from Wikipedia and popular English news media, which provides access to high-quality content with diversity. Automatic evaluation on a large-scale dataset collected from Reddit shows that our model yields significantly higher BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR scores than the state-of-the-art and non-trivial comparisons.

We explore coarse-to-fine models for creating narrative texts of several hundred words, and introduce new models which decompose stories by abstracting over actions and entities. The model first generates the predicate-argument structure of the text, where different mentions of the same entity are marked with placeholder tokens. It then generates a surface realization of the predicate-argument structure, and finally replaces the entity placeholders with context-sensitive names and references. Human judges prefer the stories from our models to a wide range of previous approaches to hierarchical text generation.

Collecting and annotating training data for these new tasks is costly since it involves real user interactions. We propose a domain adaptive dialog generation method based on meta-learning (DAML). DAML is an end-to-end trainable dialog system model that learns from multiple rich-resource tasks and then adapts to new domains with minimal training samples. We train a dialog system model using multiple rich-resource single-domain dialog data by applying the model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm to dialog domain. The model is capable of learning a competitive dialog system on a new domain with only a few training examples in an efficient manner. The two-step gradient updates in DAML enable the model to learn general features across multiple tasks. We evaluate our method on a simulated dialog dataset and achieve state-of-the-art performance, which is generalizable to new tasks.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1253,,Domain Adaptive Dialog Generation via Meta Learning,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1253/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

In our study, we extend an existing data set for this problem, and we achieve significantly better performance by using social network homophily that has not been fully exploited in previous work.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractAccompanied by modern industrial developments, air pollution has already become a major concern for human health. Hence, air quality measures, such as the concentration of PM2.5, have attracted increasing attention. Even some studies apply historical measurements into air quality forecast, the changes of air quality conditions are still hard to monitor. In this paper, we propose to exploit social media and natural language processing techniques to enhance air quality prediction. Social media users are treated as social sensors with their findings and locations. After filtering noisy tweets using word selection and topic modeling, a deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks and over-tweet-pooling is proposed to enhance air quality prediction. We conduct experiments on 7-month real-world Twitter datasets in the five most heavily polluted states in the USA. The results show that our approach significantly improves air quality prediction over the baseline that does not use social media by 6.9% to 17.7% in macro-F1 scores.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1251,,Enhancing Air Quality Prediction with Social Media and Natural Language Processing,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1251/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

To this end, we create a new dataset including 100K+ Japanese comments with constructiveness scores (C-scores). Our experiments clarify that C-scores are not always related to users’ positive feedback, and the performance of pairwise ranking models tends to be enhanced by the variation of comments rather than articles.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1250,,Dataset Creation for Ranking Constructive News Comments,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1250/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Our model consists of three main components: 1) A coherence-based attention layer embeds coherent evidence considering the claim and sentences from relevant articles; 2) An entailment-based attention layer attends on sentences that can semantically infer the claim on top of the first attention; and 3) An output layer predicts the verdict based on the embedded evidence.

To facilitate automatic language understanding, we study keyphrase prediction, distilling salient information from massive posts. While most existing methods extract words from source posts to form keyphrases, we propose a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) based neural keyphrase generation framework, enabling absent keyphrases to be created. Moreover, our model, being topic-aware, allows joint modeling of corpus-level latent topic representations, which helps alleviate data sparsity widely exhibited in social media language. Experiments on three datasets collected from English and Chinese social media platforms show that our model significantly outperforms both extraction and generation models without exploiting latent topics.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractSarcasm is a subtle form of language in which people express the opposite of what is implied. Previous works of sarcasm detection focused on texts. However, more and more social media platforms like Twitter allow users to create multi-modal messages, including texts, images, and videos. It is insufficient to detect sarcasm from multi-model messages based only on texts. In this paper, we focus on multi-modal sarcasm detection for tweets consisting of texts and images in Twitter. We treat text features, image features and image attributes as three modalities and propose a multi-modal hierarchical fusion model to address this task. Our model first extracts image features and attribute features, and then leverages attribute features and bidirectional LSTM network to extract text features. Features of three modalities are then reconstructed and fused into one feature vector for prediction. We create a multi-modal sarcasm detection dataset based on Twitter.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractUnsupervised PCFG inducers hypothesize sets of compact context-free rules as explanations for sentences. PCFG induction not only provides tools for low-resource languages, but also plays an important role in modeling language acquisition (Bannard et al., 2009; Abend et al. 2017). However, current PCFG induction models, using word tokens as input, are unable to incorporate semantics and morphology into induction, and may encounter issues of sparse vocabulary when facing morphologically rich languages. This paper describes a neural PCFG inducer which employs context embeddings (Peters et al., 2018) in a normalizing flow model (Dinh et al., 2015) to extend PCFG induction to use semantic and morphological information. Linguistically motivated sparsity and categorical distance constraints are imposed on the inducer as regularization.

Most existing work considers a supervised setting, making use of labeled data for both the source and target domains.

To address this issue, we consider using cross-domain LM as a bridge cross-domains for NER domain adaptation, performing cross-domain and cross-task knowledge transfer by designing a novel parameter generation network.

Results show that variance of average surprisal (VAS) better correlates with parsing accuracy than data likelihood and that using VAS instead of data likelihood for model selection provides a significant accuracy boost.

We deepen the state transition path at each position in a sentence, and further assign every token with a global representation learned from the entire sentence.

A key feature of the proposed method is that it does not require the dictionaries to label every entity within a sentence, and it even does not require the dictionaries to label all of the words constituting an entity. This greatly reduces the requirement on the quality of the dictionaries and makes our method generalize well with quite simple dictionaries.

Therefore, it is essential to investigate cross-lingual OpenQA. In this paper, we construct a novel dataset XQA for cross-lingual OpenQA research. It consists of a training set in English as well as development and test sets in eight other languages. Besides, we provide several baseline systems for cross-lingual OpenQA, including two machine translation-based methods and one zero-shot cross-lingual method (multilingual BERT). Experimental results show that the multilingual BERT model achieves the best results in almost all target languages, while the performance of cross-lingual OpenQA is still much lower than that of English. Our analysis indicates that the performance of cross-lingual OpenQA is related to not only how similar the target language and English are, but also how difficult the question set of the target language is.

Using a question taxonomy loosely based on Lehnert (1978), we classify questions in existing reading comprehension datasets as either GENERAL or SPECIFIC .

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractThis paper focuses on the topic of inferential machine comprehension, which aims to fully understand the meanings of given text to answer generic questions, especially the ones needed reasoning skills. In particular, we first encode the given document, question and options in a context aware way. We then propose a new network to solve the inference problem by decomposing it into a series of attention-based reasoning steps. The result of the previous step acts as the context of next step. To make each step can be directly inferred from the text, we design an operational cell with prior structure. By recursively linking the cells, the inferred results are synthesized together to form the evidence chain for reasoning, where the reasoning direction can be guided by imposing structural constraints to regulate interactions on the cells. Moreover, a termination mechanism is introduced to dynamically determine the uncertain reasoning depth, and the network is trained by reinforcement learning. Experimental results on 3 popular data sets, including MCTest, RACE and MultiRC, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1217,,Inferential Machine Comprehension: Answering Questions by Recursively Deducing the Evidence Chain from Text,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1217/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

On the one hand, we propose a data enrichment method, which uses WordNet to extract inter-word semantic connections as general knowledge from each given passage-question pair. On the other hand, we propose an end-to-end MRC model named as Knowledge Aided Reader (KAR), which explicitly uses the above extracted general knowledge to assist its attention mechanisms. Based on the data enrichment method, KAR is comparable in performance with the state-of-the-art MRC models, and significantly more robust to noise than them. When only a subset (20%-80%) of the training examples are available, KAR outperforms the state-of-the-art MRC models by a large margin, and is still reasonably robust to noise.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1219,,Explicit Utilization of General Knowledge in Machine Reading Comprehension,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1219/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Our method iteratively retrieves supporting paragraphs by forming a joint vector representation of both a question and a paragraph. The retrieval is performed by considering contextualized sentence-level representations of the paragraphs in the knowledge source.

The core module of the dynamic self-attention is a proposed gated token selection mechanism, which dynamically selects important tokens from a sequence. These chosen tokens will attend to each other via a self-attention mechanism to model long-range dependencies. Besides, convolutional layers are combined with the dynamic self-attention to enhance the model’s capacity of extracting local semantic.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractThis paper considers the reading comprehension task in which multiple documents are given as input. Prior work has shown that a pipeline of retriever, reader, and reranker can improve the overall performance. However, the pipeline system is inefficient since the input is re-encoded within each module, and is unable to leverage upstream components to help downstream training. In this work, we present RE3QA, a unified question answering model that combines context retrieving, reading comprehension, and answer reranking to predict the final answer. Unlike previous pipelined approaches, RE3QA shares contextualized text representation across different components, and is carefully designed to use high-quality upstream outputs (e.g., retrieved context or candidate answers) for directly supervising downstream modules (e.g., the reader or the reranker). As a result, the whole network can be trained end-to-end to avoid the context inconsistency problem. Experiments show that our model outperforms the pipelined baseline and achieves state-of-the-art results on two versions of TriviaQA and two variants of SQuAD.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1221,,"Retrieve, Read, Rerank: Towards End-to-End Multi-Document Reading Comprehension",https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1221/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractThis study tackles generative reading comprehension (RC), which consists of answering questions based on textual evidence and natural language generation (NLG). We propose a multi-style abstractive summarization model for question answering, called Masque. The proposed model has two key characteristics. First, unlike most studies on RC that have focused on extracting an answer span from the provided passages, our model instead focuses on generating a summary from the question and multiple passages. This serves to cover various answer styles required for real-world applications. Second, whereas previous studies built a specific model for each answer style because of the difficulty of acquiring one general model, our approach learns multi-style answers within a model to improve the NLG capability for all styles involved. This also enables our model to give an answer in the target style. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Q&A task and the Q&A + NLG task of MS MARCO 2.1 and the summary task of NarrativeQA. We observe that the transfer of the style-independent NLG capability to the target style is the key to its success.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1220,,Multi-style Generative Reading Comprehension,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1220/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractMulti-sentence compression (MSC) aims to generate a grammatical but reduced compression from multiple input sentences while retaining their key information. Previous dominating approach for MSC is the extraction-based word graph approach. A few variants further leveraged lexical substitution to yield more abstractive compression. However, two limitations exist. First, the word graph approach that simply concatenates fragments from multiple sentences may yield non-fluent or ungrammatical compression. Second, lexical substitution is often inappropriate without the consideration of context information. To tackle the above-mentioned issues, we present a neural rewriter for multi-sentence compression that does not need any parallel corpus. Empirical studies have shown that our approach achieves comparable results upon automatic evaluation and improves the grammaticality of compression based on human evaluation. A parallel corpus with more than 140,000 (sentence group, compression) pairs is also constructed as a by-product for future research.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1216,,Unsupervised Rewriter for Multi-Sentence Compression,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1216/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Experiments on the widely-used CNN/DM dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed auxiliary tasks. Furthermore, we show that after pre-training, a clean model with simple building blocks is able to outperform previous state-of-the-art that are carefully designed.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1214,,Self-Supervised Learning for Contextualized Extractive Summarization,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1214/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractWhile recent progress on abstractive summarization has led to remarkably fluent summaries, factual errors in generated summaries still severely limit their use in practice. In this paper, we evaluate summaries produced by state-of-the-art models via crowdsourcing and show that such errors occur frequently, in particular with more abstractive models. We study whether textual entailment predictions can be used to detect such errors and if they can be reduced by reranking alternative predicted summaries. That leads to an interesting downstream application for entailment models. In our experiments, we find that out-of-the-box entailment models trained on NLI datasets do not yet offer the desired performance for the downstream task and we therefore release our annotations as additional test data for future extrinsic evaluations of NLI.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1213,,Ranking Generated Summaries by Correctness: An Interesting but Challenging Application for Natural Language Inference,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1213/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractA common issue in training a deep learning, abstractive summarization model is lack of a large set of training summaries. This paper examines techniques for adapting from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain in the context of an encoder-decoder model for text generation. In addition to adversarial domain adaptation (ADA), we introduce the use of artificial titles and sequential training to capture the grammatical style of the unlabeled target domain. Evaluation on adapting to/from news articles and Stack Exchange posts indicates that the use of these techniques can boost performance for both unsupervised adaptation as well as fine-tuning with limited target data.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1211,,Adversarial Domain Adaptation Using Artificial Titles for Abstractive Title Generation,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1211/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractTranscripts of natural, multi-person meetings differ significantly from documents like news articles, which can make Natural Language Generation models for generating summaries unfocused. We develop an abstractive meeting summarizer from both videos and audios of meeting recordings. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal hierarchical attention across three levels: segment, utterance and word. To narrow down the focus into topically-relevant segments, we jointly model topic segmentation and summarization. In addition to traditional text features, we introduce new multi-modal features derived from visual focus of attention, based on the assumption that the utterance is more important if the speaker receives more attention.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractMost existing text summarization datasets are compiled from the news domain, where summaries have a flattened discourse structure. In such datasets, summary-worthy content often appears in the beginning of input articles. Moreover, large segments from input articles are present verbatim in their respective summaries. These issues impede the learning and evaluation of systems that can understand an article’s global content structure as well as produce abstractive summaries with high compression ratio. In this work, we present a novel dataset, BIGPATENT, consisting of 1.3 million records of U.S. patent documents along with human written abstractive summaries. Compared to existing summarization datasets, BIGPATENT has the following properties: i) summaries contain a richer discourse structure with more recurring entities, ii) salient content is evenly distributed in the input, and iii) lesser and shorter extractive fragments are present in the summaries. Finally, we train and evaluate baselines and popular learning models on BIGPATENT to shed light on new challenges and motivate future directions for summarization research.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1212,,BIGPATENT: A Large-Scale Dataset for Abstractive and Coherent Summarization,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1212/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractWhen writing a summary, humans tend to choose content from one or two sentences and merge them into a single summary sentence. However, the mechanisms behind the selection of one or multiple source sentences remain poorly understood. Sentence fusion assumes multi-sentence input; yet sentence selection methods only work with single sentences and not combinations of them. There is thus a crucial gap between sentence selection and fusion to support summarizing by both compressing single sentences and fusing pairs. This paper attempts to bridge the gap by ranking sentence singletons and pairs together in a unified space. Our proposed framework attempts to model human methodology by selecting either a single sentence or a pair of sentences, then compressing or fusing the sentence(s) to produce a summary sentence. We conduct extensive experiments on both single- and multi-document summarization datasets and report findings on sentence selection and abstraction.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1209,,Scoring Sentence Singletons and Pairs for Abstractive Summarization,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1209/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractGenerating keyphrases that summarize the main points of a document is a fundamental task in natural language processing. Although existing generative models are capable of predicting multiple keyphrases for an input document as well as determining the number of keyphrases to generate, they still suffer from the problem of generating too few keyphrases. To address this problem, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for keyphrase generation, with an adaptive reward function that encourages a model to generate both sufficient and accurate keyphrases. Furthermore, we introduce a new evaluation method that incorporates name variations of the ground-truth keyphrases using the Wikipedia knowledge base. Thus, our evaluation method can more robustly evaluate the quality of predicted keyphrases. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets of different scales demonstrate that our RL approach consistently and significantly improves the performance of the state-of-the-art generative models with both conventional and new evaluation methods.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1208,,Neural Keyphrase Generation via Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Rewards,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1208/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

We assume that a review can be described as a discourse tree, in which the summary is the root, and the child sentences explain their parent in detail. By recursively estimating a parent from its children, our model learns the latent discourse tree without an external parser and generates a concise summary. We also introduce an architecture that ranks the importance of each sentence on the tree to support summary generation focusing on the main review point. The experimental results demonstrate that our model is competitive with or outperforms other unsupervised approaches. In particular, for relatively long reviews, it achieves a competitive or better performance than supervised models. The induced tree shows that the child sentences provide additional information about their parent, and the generated summary abstracts the entire review.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1206,,Unsupervised Neural Single-Document Summarization of Reviews via Learning Latent Discourse Structure and its Ranking,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1206/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

To tackle the above difficulties, we propose a Transformer-based encoder-decoder framework with two novel extensions for abstractive document summarization. Specifically, (1) to encode the documents comprehensively, we design a focus-attention mechanism and incorporate it into the encoder. This mechanism models a Gaussian focal bias on attention scores to enhance the perception of local context, which contributes to producing salient and informative summaries. (2) To distinguish salient information precisely, we design an independent saliency-selection network which manages the information flow from encoder to decoder. This network effectively reduces the influences of secondary information on the generated summaries.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractSemantic parsing aims to transform natural language (NL) utterances into formal meaning representations (MRs), whereas an NL generator achieves the reverse: producing an NL description for some given MRs. Despite this intrinsic connection, the two tasks are often studied separately in prior work. In this paper, we model the duality of these two tasks via a joint learning framework, and demonstrate its effectiveness of boosting the performance on both tasks. Concretely, we propose a novel method of dual information maximization (DIM) to regularize the learning process, where DIM empirically maximizes the variational lower bounds of expected joint distributions of NL and MRs. We further extend DIM to a semi-supervision setup (SemiDIM), which leverages unlabeled data of both tasks.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractVariational autoencoders (VAEs) have received much attention recently as an end-to-end architecture for text generation with latent variables. However, previous works typically focus on synthesizing relatively short sentences (up to 20 words), and the posterior collapse issue has been widely identified in text-VAEs. In this paper, we propose to leverage several multi-level structures to learn a VAE model for generating long, and coherent text. In particular, a hierarchy of stochastic layers between the encoder and decoder networks is employed to abstract more informative and semantic-rich latent codes. Besides, we utilize a multi-level decoder structure to capture the coherent long-term structure inherent in long-form texts, by generating intermediate sentence representations as high-level plan vectors. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multi-level VAE model produces more coherent and less repetitive long text compared to baselines as well as can mitigate the posterior-collapse issue.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1200,,Towards Generating Long and Coherent Text with Multi-Level Latent Variable Models,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1200/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractWe present a syntax-infused variational autoencoder (SIVAE), that integrates sentences with their syntactic trees to improve the grammar of generated sentences. Distinct from existing VAE-based text generative models, SIVAE contains two separate latent spaces, for sentences and syntactic trees. The evidence lower bound objective is redesigned correspondingly, by optimizing a joint distribution that accommodates two encoders and two decoders. SIVAE works with long short-term memory architectures to simultaneously generate sentences and syntactic trees. Two versions of SIVAE are proposed: one captures the dependencies between the latent variables through a conditional prior network, and the other treats the latent variables independently such that syntactically-controlled sentence generation can be performed. Experimental results demonstrate the generative superiority of SIVAE on both reconstruction and targeted syntactic evaluations. Finally, we show that the proposed models can be used for unsupervised paraphrasing given different syntactic tree templates.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1199,,Syntax-Infused Variational Autoencoder for Text Generation,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1199/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

To solve these problems, we propose a head-modifier template based method to ensure the readability and data fidelity of generated type descriptions.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractIn this paper, we focus on the task of fine-grained text sentiment transfer (FGST). This task aims to revise an input sequence to satisfy a given sentiment intensity, while preserving the original semantic content. Different from the conventional sentiment transfer task that only reverses the sentiment polarity (positive/negative) of text, the FTST task requires more nuanced and fine-grained control of sentiment. To remedy this, we propose a novel Seq2SentiSeq model. Specifically, the numeric sentiment intensity value is incorporated into the decoder via a Gaussian kernel layer to finely control the sentiment intensity of the output. Moreover, to tackle the problem of lacking parallel data, we propose a cycle reinforcement learning algorithm to guide the model training. In this framework, the elaborately designed rewards can balance both sentiment transformation and content preservation, while not requiring any ground truth output. Experimental results show that our approach can outperform existing methods by a large margin in both automatic evaluation and human evaluation.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1194,,Towards Fine-grained Text Sentiment Transfer,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1194/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractAutomatic topic-to-essay generation is a challenging task since it requires generating novel, diverse, and topic-consistent paragraph-level text with a set of topics as input. Previous work tends to perform essay generation based solely on the given topics while ignoring massive commonsense knowledge. However, this commonsense knowledge provides additional background information, which can help to generate essays that are more novel and diverse. Towards filling this gap, we propose to integrate commonsense from the external knowledge base into the generator through dynamic memory mechanism. Besides, the adversarial training based on a multi-label discriminator is employed to further improve topic-consistency. We also develop a series of automatic evaluation metrics to comprehensively assess the quality of the generated essay. Experiments show that with external commonsense knowledge and adversarial training, the generated essays are more novel, diverse, and topic-consistent than existing methods in terms of both automatic and human evaluation.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1193,,Enhancing Topic-to-Essay Generation with External Commonsense Knowledge,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1193/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Most existing methods adopt the encoder-decoder framework to learn the transformation, which requires large-scale training samples. However, the lack of large parallel data is a major practical problem for many domains. In this work, we consider the scenario of low resource table-to-text generation, where only limited parallel data is available. We propose a novel model to separate the generation into two stages: key fact prediction and surface realization. It first predicts the key facts from the tables, and then generates the text with the key facts. The training of key fact prediction needs much fewer annotated data, while surface realization can be trained with pseudo parallel corpus. We evaluate our model on a biography generation dataset.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractRecent approaches to data-to-text generation have shown great promise thanks to the use of large-scale datasets and the application of neural network architectures which are trained end-to-end.

Text is generated conditioned on the data input and entity memory representations using hierarchical attention at each time step.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractSupervised models suffer from the problem of domain shifting where distribution mismatch in the data across domains greatly affect model performance. To solve the problem, training data selection (TDS) has been proven to be a prospective solution for domain adaptation in leveraging appropriate data. However, conventional TDS methods normally requires a predefined threshold which is neither easy to set nor can be applied across tasks, and models are trained separately with the TDS process. To make TDS self-adapted to data and task, and to combine it with model training, in this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that synchronously searches for training instances relevant to the target domain and learns better representations for them. A selection distribution generator (SDG) is designed to perform the selection and is updated according to the rewards computed from the selected data, where a predictor is included in the framework to ensure a task-specific model can be trained on the selected data and provides feedback to rewards. Experimental results from part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and sentiment analysis, as well as ablation studies, illustrate that the proposed framework is not only effective in data selection and representation, but also generalized to accommodate different NLP tasks.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1189,,Reinforced Training Data Selection for Domain Adaptation,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1189/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Our method takes inspiration from the idea that it should be easier to ground language to concepts that have already been formed through pre-linguistic observation. We augment a baseline instruction-following learner with an initial environment-learning phase that uses observations of language-free state transitions to induce a suitable latent representation of actions before processing the instruction-following training data.

First, we construct a high recall list of candidate entities for each mention in an unlabeled document. Second, we use the candidate lists as weak supervision to constrain our document-level entity linking model. The model treats entities as latent variables and, when estimated on a collection of unlabelled texts, learns to choose entities relying both on local context of each mention and on coherence with other entities in the document. The resulting approach rivals fully-supervised state-of-the-art systems on standard test sets. It also approaches their performance in the very challenging setting: when tested on a test set sampled from the data used to estimate the supervised systems.

Next, we explore a multi-task architecture search (MAS) approach over ENAS for finding a unified, single cell structure that performs well across multiple tasks (via joint controller rewards), and hence allows more generalizable transfer of the cell structure knowledge to an unseen new task.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractIn this paper, we address a novel task, namely weakly-supervised spatio-temporally grounding natural sentence in video. Specifically, given a natural sentence and a video, we localize a spatio-temporal tube in the video that semantically corresponds to the given sentence, with no reliance on any spatio-temporal annotations during training. First, a set of spatio-temporal tubes, referred to as instances, are extracted from the video. We then encode these instances and the sentence using our newly proposed attentive interactor which can exploit their fine-grained relationships to characterize their matching behaviors. Besides a ranking loss, a novel diversity loss is introduced to train our attentive interactor to strengthen the matching behaviors of reliable instance-sentence pairs and penalize the unreliable ones. We also contribute a dataset, called VID-sentence, based on the ImageNet video object detection dataset, to serve as a benchmark for our task. Results from extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model over the baseline approaches.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1183,,Weakly-Supervised Spatio-Temporally Grounding Natural Sentence in Video,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1183/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractDescribing images with text is a fundamental problem in vision-language research. Current studies in this domain mostly focus on single image captioning. However, in various real applications (e.g., image editing, difference interpretation, and retrieval), generating relational captions for two images, can also be very useful. This important problem has not been explored mostly due to lack of datasets and effective models. To push forward the research in this direction, we first introduce a new language-guided image editing dataset that contains a large number of real image pairs with corresponding editing instructions. We then propose a new relational speaker model based on an encoder-decoder architecture with static relational attention and sequential multi-head attention. We also extend the model with dynamic relational attention, which calculates visual alignment while decoding. Our models are evaluated on our newly collected and two public datasets consisting of image pairs annotated with relationship sentences. Experimental results, based on both automatic and human evaluation, demonstrate that our model outperforms all baselines and existing methods on all the datasets.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1182,,Expressing Visual Relationships via Language,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1182/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractPrevious work on end-to-end translation from speech has primarily used frame-level features as speech representations, which creates longer, sparser sequences than text. We show that a naive method to create compressed phoneme-like speech representations is far more effective and efficient for translation than traditional frame-level speech features. Specifically, we generate phoneme labels for speech frames and average consecutive frames with the same label to create shorter, higher-level source sequences for translation. We see improvements of up to 5 BLEU on both our high and low resource language pairs, with a reduction in training time of 60%. Our improvements hold across multiple data sizes and two language pairs.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1179,,Exploring Phoneme-Level Speech Representations for End-to-End Speech Translation,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1179/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractWe present the Visually Grounded Neural Syntax Learner (VG-NSL), an approach for learning syntactic representations and structures without any explicit supervision. The model learns by looking at natural images and reading paired captions. VG-NSL generates constituency parse trees of texts, recursively composes representations for constituents, and matches them with images. We define concreteness of constituents by their matching scores with images, and use it to guide the parsing of text. Experiments on the MSCOCO data set show that VG-NSL outperforms various unsupervised parsing approaches that do not use visual grounding, in terms of F1 scores against gold parse trees. We find that VGNSL is much more stable with respect to the choice of random initialization and the amount of training data. We also find that the concreteness acquired by VG-NSL correlates well with a similar measure defined by linguists. Finally, we also apply VG-NSL to multiple languages in the Multi30K data set, showing that our model consistently outperforms prior unsupervised approaches.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1180,,Visually Grounded Neural Syntax Acquisition,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1180/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractUsers of machine translation systems may desire to obtain multiple candidates translated in different ways. In this work, we attempt to obtain diverse translations by using sentence codes to condition the sentence generation. We describe two methods to extract the codes, either with or without the help of syntax information. For diverse generation, we sample multiple candidates, each of which conditioned on a unique code. Experiments show that the sampled translations have much higher diversity scores when using reasonable sentence codes, where the translation quality is still on par with the baselines even under strong constraint imposed by the codes. In qualitative analysis, we show that our method is able to generate paraphrase translations with drastically different structures. The proposed approach can be easily adopted to existing translation systems as no modification to the model is required.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1177,,Generating Diverse Translations with Sentence Codes,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1177/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractAdvances in learning and representations have reinvigorated work that connects language to other modalities. A particularly exciting direction is Vision-and-Language Navigation(VLN), in which agents interpret natural language instructions and visual scenes to move through environments and reach goals. Despite recent progress, current research leaves unclear how much of a role language under-standing plays in this task, especially because dominant evaluation metrics have focused on goal completion rather than the sequence of actions corresponding to the instructions. Here, we highlight shortcomings of current metrics for the Room-to-Room dataset (Anderson et al.,2018b) and propose a new metric, Coverage weighted by Length Score (CLS). We also show that the existing paths in the dataset are not ideal for evaluating instruction following because they are direct-to-goal shortest paths. We join existing short paths to form more challenging extended paths to create a new data set, Room-for-Room (R4R). Using R4R and CLS, we show that agents that receive rewards for instruction fidelity outperform agents that focus on goal completion.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1181,,Stay on the Path: Instruction Fidelity in Vision-and-Language Navigation,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1181/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractTransformer is the state-of-the-art model in recent machine translation evaluations. Two strands of research are promising to improve models of this kind: the first uses wide networks (a.k.a. Transformer-Big) and has been the de facto standard for development of the Transformer system, and the other uses deeper language representation but faces the difficulty arising from learning deep networks. Here, we continue the line of research on the latter. We claim that a truly deep Transformer model can surpass the Transformer-Big counterpart by 1) proper use of layer normalization and 2) a novel way of passing the combination of previous layers to the next. On WMT’16 English-German and NIST OpenMT’12 Chinese-English tasks, our deep system (30/25-layer encoder) outperforms the shallow Transformer-Big/Base baseline (6-layer encoder) by 0.4-2.4 BLEU points.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractThe reordering model plays an important role in phrase-based statistical machine translation. However, there are few works that exploit the reordering information in neural machine translation. In this paper, we propose a reordering mechanism to learn the reordering embedding of a word based on its contextual information. These learned reordering embeddings are stacked together with self-attention networks to learn sentence representation for machine translation. The reordering mechanism can be easily integrated into both the encoder and the decoder in the Transformer translation system. Experimental results on WMT’14 English-to-German, NIST Chinese-to-English, and WAT Japanese-to-English translation tasks demonstrate that the proposed methods can significantly improve the performance of the Transformer.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1174,,Neural Machine Translation with Reordering Embeddings,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1174/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractA longstanding debate in semiotics centers on the relationship between linguistic signs and their corresponding semantics: is there an arbitrary relationship between a word form and its meaning, or does some systematic phenomenon pervade? For instance, does the character bigram ‘gl’ have any systematic relationship to the meaning of words like ‘glisten’, ‘gleam’ and ‘glow’? In this work, we offer a holistic quantification of the systematicity of the sign using mutual information and recurrent neural networks. We employ these in a data-driven and massively multilingual approach to the question, examining 106 languages. We find a statistically significant reduction in entropy when modeling a word form conditioned on its semantic representation. Encouragingly, we also recover well-attested English examples of systematic affixes. We conclude with the meta-point: Our approximate effect size (measured in bits) is quite small—despite some amount of systematicity between form and meaning, an arbitrary relationship and its resulting benefits dominate human language.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1171,,Meaning to Form: Measuring Systematicity as Information,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1171/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractMorphological tagging is challenging for morphologically rich languages due to the large target space and the need for more training data to minimize model sparsity. Dialectal variants of morphologically rich languages suffer more as they tend to be more noisy and have less resources. In this paper we explore the use of multitask learning and adversarial training to address morphological richness and dialectal variations in the context of full morphological tagging. We use multitask learning for joint morphological modeling for the features within two dialects, and as a knowledge-transfer scheme for cross-dialectal modeling. We use adversarial training to learn dialect invariant features that can help the knowledge-transfer scheme from the high to low-resource variants. We work with two dialectal variants: Modern Standard Arabic (high-resource “dialect’”) and Egyptian Arabic (low-resource dialect) as a case study. Our models achieve state-of-the-art results for both. Furthermore, adversarial training provides more significant improvement when using smaller training datasets in particular.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1173,,Adversarial Multitask Learning for Joint Multi-Feature and Multi-Dialect Morphological Modeling,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1173/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractGiven a small corpus D_T pertaining to a limited set of focused topics, our goal is to train embeddings that accurately capture the sense of words in the topic in spite of the limited size of D_T. These embeddings may be used in various tasks involving D_T. A popular strategy in limited data settings is to adapt pretrained embeddings E trained on a large corpus. To correct for sense drift, fine-tuning, regularization, projection, and pivoting have been proposed recently. Among these, regularization informed by a word’s corpus frequency performed well, but we improve upon it using a new regularizer based on the stability of its cooccurrence with other words. However, a thorough comparison across ten topics, spanning three tasks, with standardized settings of hyper-parameters, reveals that even the best embedding adaptation strategies provide small gains beyond well-tuned baselines, which many earlier comparisons ignored. In a bold departure from adapting pretrained embeddings, we propose using D_T to probe, attend to, and borrow fragments from any large, topic-rich source corpus (such as Wikipedia), which need not be the corpus used to pretrain embeddings. This step is made scalable and practical by suitable indexing. We reach the surprising conclusion that even limited corpus augmentation is more useful than adapting embeddings, which suggests that non-dominant sense information may be irrevocably obliterated from pretrained embeddings and cannot be salvaged by adaptation.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1168,,Topic Sensitive Attention on Generic Corpora Corrects Sense Bias in Pretrained Embeddings,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1168/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractLexical relations describe how meanings of terms relate to each other. Typical examples include hypernymy, synonymy, meronymy, etc. Automatic distinction of lexical relations is vital for NLP applications, and also challenging due to the lack of contextual signals to discriminate between such relations. In this work, we present a neural representation learning model to distinguish lexical relations among term pairs based on Hyperspherical Relation Embeddings (SphereRE). Rather than learning embeddings for individual terms, the model learns representations of relation triples by mapping them to the hyperspherical embedding space, where relation triples of different lexical relations are well separated.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractStudying the ways in which language is gendered has long been an area of interest in sociolinguistics. Studies have explored, for example, the speech of male and female characters in film and the language used to describe male and female politicians. In this paper, we aim not to merely study this phenomenon qualitatively, but instead to quantify the degree to which the language used to describe men and women is different and, moreover, different in a positive or negative way. To that end, we introduce a generative latent-variable model that jointly represents adjective (or verb) choice, with its sentiment, given the natural gender of a head (or dependent) noun. We find that there are significant differences between descriptions of male and female nouns and that these differences align with common gender stereotypes: Positive adjectives used to describe women are more often related to their bodies than adjectives used to describe men.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1167,,Unsupervised Discovery of Gendered Language through Latent-Variable Modeling,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1167/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

We show that the utilization of an architecture that is aware of word order, like an LSTM, enables us to create better representations.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractWord embeddings are often criticized for capturing undesirable word associations such as gender stereotypes. However, methods for measuring and removing such biases remain poorly understood. We show that for any embedding model that implicitly does matrix factorization, debiasing vectors post hoc using subspace projection (Bolukbasi et al., 2016) is, under certain conditions, equivalent to training on an unbiased corpus. We also prove that WEAT, the most common association test for word embeddings, systematically overestimates bias. Given that the subspace projection method is provably effective, we use it to derive a new measure of association called the relational inner product association (RIPA). Experiments with RIPA reveal that, on average, skipgram with negative sampling (SGNS) does not make most words any more gendered than they are in the training corpus. However, for gender-stereotyped words, SGNS actually amplifies the gender association in the corpus.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1166,,Understanding Undesirable Word Embedding Associations,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1166/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Then, we show that models trained on these corpora acquire and propagate these biases, such that AAE tweets and tweets by self-identified African Americans are up to two times more likely to be labelled as offensive compared to others. Finally, we propose *dialect* and *race priming* as ways to reduce the racial bias in annotation, showing that when annotators are made explicitly aware of an AAE tweet’s dialect they are significantly less likely to label the tweet as offensive.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1163,,The Risk of Racial Bias in Hate Speech Detection,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1163/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractGender stereotypes are manifest in most of the world’s languages and are consequently propagated or amplified by NLP systems. Although research has focused on mitigating gender stereotypes in English, the approaches that are commonly employed produce ungrammatical sentences in morphologically rich languages. We present a novel approach for converting between masculine-inflected and feminine-inflected sentences in such languages. For Spanish and Hebrew, our approach achieves F1 scores of 82% and 73% at the level of tags and accuracies of 90% and 87% at the level of forms. By evaluating our approach using four different languages, we show that, on average, it reduces gender stereotyping by a factor of 2.5 without any sacrifice to grammaticality.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1161,,Counterfactual Data Augmentation for Mitigating Gender Stereotypes in Languages with Rich Morphology,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1161/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractWord embedding models have gained a lot of traction in the Natural Language Processing community, however, they suffer from unintended demographic biases. Most approaches to evaluate these biases rely on vector space based metrics like the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT). While these approaches offer great geometric insights into unintended biases in the embedding vector space, they fail to offer an interpretable meaning for how the embeddings could cause discrimination in downstream NLP applications. In this work, we present a transparent framework and metric for evaluating discrimination across protected groups with respect to their word embedding bias. Our metric (Relative Negative Sentiment Bias, RNSB) measures fairness in word embeddings via the relative negative sentiment associated with demographic identity terms from various protected groups. We show that our framework and metric enable useful analysis into the bias in word embeddings.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1162,,A Transparent Framework for Evaluating Unintended Demographic Bias in Word Embeddings,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1162/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractWord embeddings learnt from massive text collections have demonstrated significant levels of discriminative biases such as gender, racial or ethnic biases, which in turn bias the down-stream NLP applications that use those word embeddings. Taking gender-bias as a working example, we propose a debiasing method that preserves non-discriminative gender-related information, while removing stereotypical discriminative gender biases from pre-trained word embeddings. Specifically, we consider four types of information: feminine, masculine, gender-neutral and stereotypical, which represent the relationship between gender vs. bias, and propose a debiasing method that (a) preserves the gender-related information in feminine and masculine words, (b) preserves the neutrality in gender-neutral words, and (c) removes the biases from stereotypical words. Experimental results on several previously proposed benchmark datasets show that our proposed method can debias pre-trained word embeddings better than existing SoTA methods proposed for debiasing word embeddings while preserving gender-related but non-discriminative information.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1160,,Gender-preserving Debiasing for Pre-trained Word Embeddings,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1160/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractAs Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) tools rise in popularity, it becomes increasingly vital to recognize the role they play in shaping societal biases and stereotypes. Although NLP models have shown success in modeling various applications, they propagate and may even amplify gender bias found in text corpora. While the study of bias in artificial intelligence is not new, methods to mitigate gender bias in NLP are relatively nascent. In this paper, we review contemporary studies on recognizing and mitigating gender bias in NLP. We discuss gender bias based on four forms of representation bias and analyze methods recognizing gender bias. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of existing gender debiasing methods.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractFor unsegmented languages such as Japanese and Chinese, tokenization of a sentence has a significant impact on the performance of text classification. Sentences are usually segmented with words or subwords by a morphological analyzer or byte pair encoding and then encoded with word (or subword) representations for neural networks. However, segmentation is potentially ambiguous, and it is unclear whether the segmented tokens achieve the best performance for the target task. In this paper, we propose a method to simultaneously learn tokenization and text classification to address these problems. Our model incorporates a language model for unsupervised tokenization into a text classifier and then trains both models simultaneously. To make the model robust against infrequent tokens, we sampled segmentation for each sentence stochastically during training, which resulted in improved performance of text classification. We conducted experiments on sentiment analysis as a text classification task and show that our method achieves better performance than previous methods.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1158,,Stochastic Tokenization with a Language Model for Neural Text Classification,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1158/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

However, naturally occurring multimodal data is often imperfect as a result of imperfect modalities, missing entries or noise corruption. To address these concerns, we present a regularization method based on tensor rank minimization. Our method is based on the observation that high-dimensional multimodal time series data often exhibit correlations across time and modalities which leads to low-rank tensor representations. However, the presence of noise or incomplete values breaks these correlations and results in tensor representations of higher rank. We design a model to learn such tensor representations and effectively regularize their rank. Experiments on multimodal language data show that our model achieves good results across various levels of imperfection.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1152,,Learning Representations from Imperfect Time Series Data via Tensor Rank Regularization,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1152/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

In this paper, we introduce: (i) an agreement score to evaluate the performance of routing processes at instance-level; (ii) an adaptive optimizer to enhance the reliability of routing; (iii) capsule compression and partial routing to improve the scalability of capsule networks. We validate our approach on two NLP tasks, namely: multi-label text classification and question answering. Experimental results show that our approach considerably improves over strong competitors on both tasks.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractSequence-to-sequence models are a powerful workhorse of NLP. Most variants employ a softmax transformation in both their attention mechanism and output layer, leading to dense alignments and strictly positive output probabilities. This density is wasteful, making models less interpretable and assigning probability mass to many implausible outputs. In this paper, we propose sparse sequence-to-sequence models, rooted in a new family of 𝛼-entmax transformations, which includes softmax and sparsemax as particular cases, and is sparse for any 𝛼 > 1. We provide fast algorithms to evaluate these transformations and their gradients, which scale well for large vocabulary sizes. Our models are able to produce sparse alignments and to assign nonzero probability to a short list of plausible outputs, sometimes rendering beam search exact. Experiments on morphological inflection and machine translation reveal consistent gains over dense models.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1146,,Sparse Sequence-to-Sequence Models,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1146/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

LRN uses input and forget gates to handle long-range dependencies as well as gradient vanishing and explosion, with all parameter related calculations factored outside the recurrence. The recurrence in LRN only manipulates the weight assigned to each token, tightly connecting LRN with self-attention networks.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractGazetteers were shown to be useful resources for named entity recognition (NER). Many existing approaches to incorporating gazetteers into machine learning based NER systems rely on manually defined selection strategies or handcrafted templates, which may not always lead to optimal effectiveness, especially when multiple gazetteers are involved. This is especially the case for the task of Chinese NER, where the words are not naturally tokenized, leading to additional ambiguities. To automatically learn how to incorporate multiple gazetteers into an NER system, we propose a novel approach based on graph neural networks with a multi-digraph structure that captures the information that the gazetteers offer.

Using such models, multiple potential segmentations usually exist for a given string, for example one using words and one using characters only. Thus, the probability of a string is the sum of the probabilities of all the possible segmentations. Here, we show how it is possible to marginalize over the segmentations efficiently, in order to compute the true probability of a sequence.

However, these methods require significant expert labor to write relation-specific patterns, which makes them too sophisticated to generalize quickly. To ease the labor-intensive workload of pattern writing and enable the quick generalization to new relation types, we propose a neural pattern diagnosis framework, DIAG-NRE, that can automatically summarize and refine high-quality relational patterns from noise data with human experts in the loop.

Different from traditional approaches regarding NER as a sequential labeling task and annotate entities consecutively, MGNER detects and recognizes entities on multiple granularities: it is able to recognize named entities without explicitly assuming non-overlapping or totally nested structures. MGNER consists of a Detector that examines all possible word segments and a Classifier that categorizes entities. In addition, contextual information and a self-attention mechanism are utilized throughout the framework to improve the NER performance. Experimental results show that MGNER outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines up to 4.4% in terms of the F1 score among nested/non-overlapping NER tasks.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1138,,Multi-grained Named Entity Recognition,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1138/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractDistant supervision is widely used in relation classification in order to create large-scale training data by aligning a knowledge base with an unlabeled corpus. However, it also introduces amounts of noisy labels where a contextual sentence actually does not express the labeled relation. In this paper, we propose ARNOR, a novel Attention Regularization based NOise Reduction framework for distant supervision relation classification. ARNOR assumes that a trustable relation label should be explained by the neural attention model. Specifically, our ARNOR framework iteratively learns an interpretable model and utilizes it to select trustable instances. We first introduce attention regularization to force the model to pay attention to the patterns which explain the relation labels, so as to make the model more interpretable. Then, if the learned model can clearly locate the relation patterns of a candidate instance in the training set, we will select it as a trustable instance for further training step. According to the experiments on NYT data, our ARNOR framework achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both relation classification performance and noise reduction effect.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1135,,ARNOR: Attention Regularization based Noise Reduction for Distant Supervision Relation Classification,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1135/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractDistantly supervised relation extraction is widely used to extract relational facts from text, but suffers from noisy labels. Current relation extraction methods try to alleviate the noise by multi-instance learning and by providing supporting linguistic and contextual information to more efficiently guide the relation classification. While achieving state-of-the-art results, we observed these models to be biased towards recognizing a limited set of relations with high precision, while ignoring those in the long tail. To address this gap, we utilize a pre-trained language model, the OpenAI Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) (Radford et al., 2018). The GPT and similar models have been shown to capture semantic and syntactic features, and also a notable amount of “common-sense” knowledge, which we hypothesize are important features for recognizing a more diverse set of relations. By extending the GPT to the distantly supervised setting, and fine-tuning it on the NYT10 dataset, we show that it predicts a larger set of distinct relation types with high confidence. Manual and automated evaluation of our model shows that it achieves a state-of-the-art AUC score of 0.422 on the NYT10 dataset, and performs especially well at higher recall levels.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1134,,Fine-tuning Pre-Trained Transformer Language Models to Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1134/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractUnsupervised relation extraction aims at extracting relations between entities in text. Previous unsupervised approaches are either generative or discriminative. In a supervised setting, discriminative approaches, such as deep neural network classifiers, have demonstrated substantial improvement. However, these models are hard to train without supervision, and the currently proposed solutions are unstable. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a skewness loss which encourages the classifier to predict a relation with confidence given a sentence, and a distribution distance loss enforcing that all relations are predicted in average. These losses improve the performance of discriminative based models, and enable us to train deep neural networks satisfactorily, surpassing current state of the art on three different datasets.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1133,,Unsupervised Information Extraction: Regularizing Discriminative Approaches with Relation Distribution Losses,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1133/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractIn practical scenario, relation extraction needs to first identify entity pairs that have relation and then assign a correct relation class. However, the number of non-relation entity pairs in context (negative instances) usually far exceeds the others (positive instances), which negatively affects a model’s performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose a multi-task architecture which jointly trains a model to perform relation identification with cross-entropy loss and relation classification with ranking loss. Meanwhile, we observe that a sentence may have multiple entities and relation mentions, and the patterns in which the entities appear in a sentence may contain useful semantic information that can be utilized to distinguish between positive and negative instances. Thus we further incorporate the embeddings of character-wise/word-wise BIO tag from the named entity recognition task into character/word embeddings to enrich the input representation. Experiment results show that our proposed approach can significantly improve the performance of a baseline model with more than 10% absolute increase in F1-score, and outperform the state-of-the-art models on ACE 2005 Chinese and English corpus.

Experiments on the ACE and the CoNLL04 corpora demonstrate that the proposed paradigm significantly outperforms previous best models.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractSimultaneous machine translation begins to translate each source sentence before the source speaker is finished speaking, with applications to live and streaming scenarios. Simultaneous systems must carefully schedule their reading of the source sentence to balance quality against latency. We present the first simultaneous translation system to learn an adaptive schedule jointly with a neural machine translation (NMT) model that attends over all source tokens read thus far. We do so by introducing Monotonic Infinite Lookback (MILk) attention, which maintains both a hard, monotonic attention head to schedule the reading of the source sentence, and a soft attention head that extends from the monotonic head back to the beginning of the source. We show that MILk’s adaptive schedule allows it to arrive at latency-quality trade-offs that are favorable to those of a recently proposed wait-k strategy for many latency values.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1126,,Monotonic Infinite Lookback Attention for Simultaneous Machine Translation,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1126/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

We conduct experiments on the IWSLT16, WMT14 and WMT16 datasets. Our proposed model achieves a significant speedup over the autoregressive models, while keeping the translation quality comparable to the autoregressive models.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractStandard decoders for neural machine translation autoregressively generate a single target token per timestep, which slows inference especially for long outputs. While architectural advances such as the Transformer fully parallelize the decoder computations at training time, inference still proceeds sequentially. Recent developments in non- and semi-autoregressive decoding produce multiple tokens per timestep independently of the others, which improves inference speed but deteriorates translation quality. In this work, we propose the syntactically supervised Transformer (SynST), which first autoregressively predicts a chunked parse tree before generating all of the target tokens in one shot conditioned on the predicted parse. A series of controlled experiments demonstrates that SynST decodes sentences ~5x faster than the baseline autoregressive Transformer while achieving higher BLEU scores than most competing methods on En-De and En-Fr datasets.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1122,,Syntactically Supervised Transformers for Faster Neural Machine Translation,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1122/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

In previous methods, UBWE is first trained using non-parallel monolingual corpora and then this pre-trained UBWE is used to initialize the word embedding in the encoder and decoder of UNMT. That is, the training of UBWE and UNMT are separate. In this paper, we first empirically investigate the relationship between UBWE and UNMT. The empirical findings show that the performance of UNMT is significantly affected by the performance of UBWE. Thus, we propose two methods that train UNMT with UBWE agreement.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractZero-shot translation, translating between language pairs on which a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system has never been trained, is an emergent property when training the system in multilingual settings. However, naive training for zero-shot NMT easily fails, and is sensitive to hyper-parameter setting. The performance typically lags far behind the more conventional pivot-based approach which translates twice using a third language as a pivot. In this work, we address the degeneracy problem due to capturing spurious correlations by quantitatively analyzing the mutual information between language IDs of the source and decoded sentences. Inspired by this analysis, we propose to use two simple but effective approaches: (1) decoder pre-training; (2) back-translation.

Our methods do not require restructuring the vocabulary or retraining the model.

Most previous work relies on supervised systems, which are trained on parallel data, thus their applicability is problematic in low-resource scenarios. Recent developments in building unsupervised bilingual word embeddings made it possible to mine parallel sentences based on cosine similarities of source and target language words. We show that relying only on this information is not enough, since sentences often have similar words but different meanings. We detect continuous parallel segments in sentence pair candidates and rely on them when mining parallel sentences. We show better mining accuracy on three language pairs in a standard shared task on artificial data. We also provide the first experiments showing that parallel sentences mined from real life sources improve unsupervised MT.

However, this multilingual translation paradigm does not make full use of language commonality and parameter sharing between encoder and decoder. Furthermore, this kind of paradigm cannot outperform the individual models trained on bilingual corpus in most cases. In this paper, we propose a compact and language-sensitive method for multilingual translation. To maximize parameter sharing, we first present a universal representor to replace both encoder and decoder models. To make the representor sensitive for specific languages, we further introduce language-sensitive embedding, attention, and discriminator with the ability to enhance model performance. We verify our methods on various translation scenarios, including one-to-many, many-to-many and zero-shot. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed methods remarkably outperform strong standard multilingual translation systems on WMT and IWSLT datasets.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractThough machine translation errors caused by the lack of context beyond one sentence have long been acknowledged, the development of context-aware NMT systems is hampered by several problems. Firstly, standard metrics are not sensitive to improvements in consistency in document-level translations. Secondly, previous work on context-aware NMT assumed that the sentence-aligned parallel data consisted of complete documents while in most practical scenarios such document-level data constitutes only a fraction of the available parallel data. To address the first issue, we perform a human study on an English-Russian subtitles dataset and identify deixis, ellipsis and lexical cohesion as three main sources of inconsistency. We then create test sets targeting these phenomena. To address the second shortcoming, we consider a set-up in which a much larger amount of sentence-level data is available compared to that aligned at the document level. We introduce a model that is suitable for this scenario and demonstrate major gains over a context-agnostic baseline on our new benchmarks without sacrificing performance as measured with BLEU.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1116,,"When a Good Translation is Wrong in Context: Context-Aware Machine Translation Improves on Deixis, Ellipsis, and Lexical Cohesion",https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1116/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Previous work has extended recurrent neural networks to model lattice inputs and achieved improvements in various tasks, but these models suffer from very slow computation speeds. This paper extends the recently proposed paradigm of self-attention to handle lattice inputs. Self-attention is a sequence modeling technique that relates inputs to one another by computing pairwise similarities and has gained popularity for both its strong results and its computational efficiency. To extend such models to handle lattices, we introduce probabilistic reachability masks that incorporate lattice structure into the model and support lattice scores if available. We also propose a method for adapting positional embeddings to lattice structures.

Owing to the resource constraints, we formulate this task as a word ordering (linearisation) task. In doing so, we completely ignore the word arrangement at the verse side. kāvya guru, the approach we propose, essentially consists of a pipeline of two pretraining steps followed by a seq2seq model. The first pretraining step learns task-specific token embeddings from pretrained embeddings. In the next step, we generate multiple possible hypotheses for possible word arrangements of the input %using another pretraining step. We then use them as inputs to a neural seq2seq model for the final prediction. We empirically show that the hypotheses generated by our pretraining step result in predictions that consistently outperform predictions based on the original order in the verse. Overall, kāvya guru outperforms current state of the art models in linearisation for the poetry to prose conversion task in Sanskrit.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1111,,Poetry to Prose Conversion in Sanskrit as a Linearisation Task: A Case for Low-Resource Languages,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1111/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractNews recommendation can help users find interested news and alleviate information overload. The topic information of news is critical for learning accurate news and user representations for news recommendation. However, it is not considered in many existing news recommendation methods. In this paper, we propose a neural news recommendation approach with topic-aware news representations. The core of our approach is a topic-aware news encoder and a user encoder. In the news encoder we learn representations of news from their titles via CNN networks and apply attention networks to select important words. In addition, we propose to learn topic-aware news representations by jointly training the news encoder with an auxiliary topic classification task. In the user encoder we learn the representations of users from their browsed news and use attention networks to select informative news for user representation learning. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1110,,Neural News Recommendation with Topic-Aware News Representation,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1110/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Although criticised sometimes, the existing peer review system still stands as the benchmark of research validation. The present-day peer review process is not straightforward and demands profound domain knowledge, expertise, and intelligence of human reviewer(s), which is somewhat elusive with the current state of AI. However, the peer review texts, which contains rich sentiment information of the reviewer, reflecting his/her overall attitude towards the research in the paper, could be a valuable entity to predict the acceptance or rejection of the manuscript under consideration. Here in this work, we investigate the role of reviewer sentiment embedded within peer review texts to predict the peer review outcome. Our proposed deep neural architecture takes into account three channels of information: the paper, the corresponding reviews, and review’s polarity to predict the overall recommendation score as well as the final decision. We achieve significant performance improvement over the baselines (∼ 29% error reduction) proposed in a recently released dataset of peer reviews.

The key idea is that the features learned from predominant senses are possible to discriminate the domain of the document and thus improve the overall performance of text categorization. We propose multi-task learning framework based on the neural network model, transformer, which trains a model to simultaneously categorize documents and predicts a predominant sense for each word.

To obfuscate, we analyze the huge space of textual variants for a paraphrased version of the to-be-obfuscated text that has a sufficient Jensen-Shannon distance at minimal costs in terms of text quality.

The challenge of this task is to generate adversarial examples that maintain lexical correctness, grammatical correctness and semantic similarity. Based on the synonyms substitution strategy, we introduce a new word replacement order determined by both the word saliency and the classification probability, and propose a greedy algorithm called probability weighted word saliency (PWWS) for text adversarial attack. Experiments on three popular datasets using convolutional as well as LSTM models show that PWWS reduces the classification accuracy to the most extent, and keeps a very low word substitution rate. A human evaluation study shows that our generated adversarial examples maintain the semantic similarity well and are hard for humans to perceive. Performing adversarial training using our perturbed datasets improves the robustness of the models.

To address this challenge, we study the problem of efficiently combining acoustic and lexical modalities during training while still providing a deployable acoustic model that does not require lexical inputs. We first experiment with multimodal models and two attention mechanisms to assess the extent of the benefits that lexical information can provide.

However, it suffers from two shortcomings: 1) the emotion must be annotated before cause extraction in ECE, which greatly limits its applications in real-world scenarios; 2) the way to first annotate emotion and then extract the cause ignores the fact that they are mutually indicative. In this work, we propose a new task: emotion-cause pair extraction (ECPE), which aims to extract the potential pairs of emotions and corresponding causes in a document. We propose a 2-step approach to address this new ECPE task, which first performs individual emotion extraction and cause extraction via multi-task learning, and then conduct emotion-cause pairing and filtering. The experimental results on a benchmark emotion cause corpus prove the feasibility of the ECPE task as well as the effectiveness of our approach.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1096,,Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction: A New Task to Emotion Analysis in Texts,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1096/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Most of the existing systems treat this task as a pipeline of two separate tasks, i.e., named entity recognition (NER)and rule-based negation detection. We consider this as a multi-task problem and present a novel end-to-end neural model to jointly extract entities and negations. We extend a standard hierarchical encoder-decoder NER model and first adopt a shared encoder followed by separate decoders for the two tasks. This architecture performs considerably better than the previous rule-based and machine learning-based systems.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractMental health counseling is an enterprise with profound societal importance where conversations play a primary role. In order to acquire the conversational skills needed to face a challenging range of situations, mental health counselors must rely on training and on continued experience with actual clients. However, in the absence of large scale longitudinal studies, the nature and significance of this developmental process remain unclear. For example, prior literature suggests that experience might not translate into consequential changes in counselor behavior. This has led some to even argue that counseling is a profession without expertise. In this work, we develop a computational framework to quantify the extent to which individuals change their linguistic behavior with experience and to study the nature of this evolution. We use our framework to conduct a large longitudinal study of mental health counseling conversations, tracking over 3,400 counselors across their tenure. We reveal that overall, counselors do indeed change their conversational behavior to become more diverse across interactions, developing an individual voice that distinguishes them from other counselors. Furthermore, a finer-grained investigation shows that the rate and nature of this diversification vary across functionally different conversational components.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1089,,Finding Your Voice: The Linguistic Development of Mental Health Counselors,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1089/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractFact verification (FV) is a challenging task which requires to retrieve relevant evidence from plain text and use the evidence to verify given claims. Many claims require to simultaneously integrate and reason over several pieces of evidence for verification. However, previous work employs simple models to extract information from evidence without letting evidence communicate with each other, e.g., merely concatenate the evidence for processing. Therefore, these methods are unable to grasp sufficient relational and logical information among the evidence. To alleviate this issue, we propose a graph-based evidence aggregating and reasoning (GEAR) framework which enables information to transfer on a fully-connected evidence graph and then utilizes different aggregators to collect multi-evidence information. We further employ BERT, an effective pre-trained language representation model, to improve the performance. Experimental results on a large-scale benchmark dataset FEVER have demonstrated that GEAR could leverage multi-evidence information for FV and thus achieves the promising result with a test FEVER score of 67.10%.

Lack of any publicly available corpus in this privacy-sensitive domain led us to develop our own corpus, consisting of about 3K conversations annotated by professional medical scribes. We propose two novel deep learning approaches to infer the symptom names and their status: (1) a new hierarchical span-attribute tagging (SA-T) model, trained using curriculum learning, and (2) a variant of sequence-to-sequence model which decodes the symptoms and their status from a few speaker turns within a sliding window over the conversation. This task stems from a realistic application of assisting medical providers in capturing symptoms mentioned by patients from their clinical conversations. To reflect this application, we define multiple metrics. From inter-rater agreement, we find that the task is inherently difficult. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on several contrasting conditions and observe that the performance of the models range from an F-score of 0.5 to 0.8 depending on the condition.

Each InfCand consists of one of these relations, expressed as a lemmatized dependency path, and two argument placeholders, each linked to one or more Freebase types. Due to our candidate selection process based on strong distributional evidence, SherLIiC is much harder than existing testbeds because distributional evidence is of little utility in the classification of InfCands. We also show that, due to its construction, many of SherLIiC’s correct InfCands are novel and missing from existing rule bases.

We propose two probabilistic methods to build models that are more robust to such biases and better transfer across datasets. In contrast to standard approaches to NLI, our methods predict the probability of a premise given a hypothesis and NLI label, discouraging models from ignoring the premise. We evaluate our methods on synthetic and existing NLI datasets by training on datasets containing biases and testing on datasets containing no (or different) hypothesis-only biases. Our results indicate that these methods can make NLI models more robust to dataset-specific artifacts, transferring better than a baseline architecture in 9 out of 12 NLI datasets.

Experimental results on two datasets from different domains prove the validity and effectiveness of our model, where it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin.

Specifically, our retriever is a context-aware encoder-decoder model with a latent variable which takes context environment into consideration, and our meta-learner learns to utilize retrieved datapoints in a model-agnostic meta-learning paradigm for fast adaptation. We conduct experiments on CONCODE and CSQA datasets, where the context refers to class environment in JAVA codes and conversational history, respectively.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractOne of the key steps in language resource creation is the identification of the text segments to be annotated, or markables, which depending on the task may vary from nominal chunks for named entity resolution to (potentially nested) noun phrases in coreference resolution (or mentions) to larger text segments in text segmentation. Markable identification is typically carried out semi-automatically, by running a markable identifier and correcting its output by hand–which is increasingly done via annotators recruited through crowdsourcing and aggregating their responses. In this paper, we present a method for identifying markables for coreference annotation that combines high-performance automatic markable detectors with checking with a Game-With-A-Purpose (GWAP) and aggregation using a Bayesian annotation model. The method was evaluated both on news data and data from a variety of other genres and results in an improvement on F1 of mention boundaries of over seven percentage points when compared with a state-of-the-art, domain-independent automatic mention detector, and almost three points over an in-domain mention detector. One of the key contributions of our proposal is its applicability to the case in which markables are nested, as is the case with coreference markables; but the GWAP and several of the proposed markable detectors are task and language-independent and are thus applicable to a variety of other annotation scenarios.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1077,,Crowdsourcing and Aggregating Nested Markable Annotations,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1077/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractTopic models are typically evaluated with respect to the global topic distributions that they generate, using metrics such as coherence, but without regard to local (token-level) topic assignments. Token-level assignments are important for downstream tasks such as classification. Even recent models, which aim to improve the quality of these token-level topic assignments, have been evaluated only with respect to global metrics. We propose a task designed to elicit human judgments of token-level topic assignments. We use a variety of topic model types and parameters and discover that global metrics agree poorly with human assignments. Since human evaluation is expensive we propose a variety of automated metrics to evaluate topic models at a local level. Finally, we correlate our proposed metrics with human judgments from the task on several datasets. We show that an evaluation based on the percent of topic switches correlates most strongly with human judgment of local topic quality. We suggest that this new metric, which we call consistency, be adopted alongside global metrics such as topic coherence when evaluating new topic models.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1076,,Automatic Evaluation of Local Topic Quality,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1076/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

This paper codifies model and task agnostic principles for informative error analysis, and presents Errudite, an interactive tool for better supporting this process. First, error groups should be precisely defined for reproducibility; Errudite supports this with an expressive domain-specific language. Second, to avoid spurious conclusions, a large set of instances should be analyzed, including both positive and negative examples; Errudite enables systematic grouping of relevant instances with filtering queries. Third, hypotheses about the cause of errors should be explicitly tested; Errudite supports this via automated counterfactual rewriting. We validate our approach with a user study, finding that Errudite (1) enables users to perform high quality and reproducible error analyses with less effort, (2) reveals substantial ambiguities in prior published error analyses practices, and (3) enhances the error analysis experience by allowing users to test and revise prior beliefs.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1073,,"Errudite: Scalable, Reproducible, and Testable Error Analysis",https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1073/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

We find the learned latent trees have little to no structure and instead focus on lexical cues; even after obtaining more structured trees with proposed model modifications, the trees are still far from capturing discourse structure when compared to discourse dependency trees from an existing discourse parser.

In particular, besides encoding arguments (discourse units) using a gated convolutional network to obtain sentence-level representations, we train a simplified topic model to infer the latent topic-level representations. Moreover, we feed the two pairs of representations to two factored tensor networks, respectively, to capture both the sentence-level interactions and topic-level relevance using multi-slice tensors.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractThis paper focuses on two related subtasks of aspect-based sentiment analysis, namely aspect term extraction and aspect sentiment classification, which we call aspect term-polarity co-extraction. The former task is to extract aspects of a product or service from an opinion document, and the latter is to identify the polarity expressed in the document about these extracted aspects. Most existing algorithms address them as two separate tasks and solve them one by one, or only perform one task, which can be complicated for real applications. In this paper, we treat these two tasks as two sequence labeling problems and propose a novel Dual crOss-sharEd RNN framework (DOER) to generate all aspect term-polarity pairs of the input sentence simultaneously. Specifically, DOER involves a dual recurrent neural network to extract the respective representation of each task, and a cross-shared unit to consider the relationship between them.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractIn aspect-level sentiment classification (ASC), it is prevalent to equip dominant neural models with attention mechanisms, for the sake of acquiring the importance of each context word on the given aspect. However, such a mechanism tends to excessively focus on a few frequent words with sentiment polarities, while ignoring infrequent ones. In this paper, we propose a progressive self-supervised attention learning approach for neural ASC models, which automatically mines useful attention supervision information from a training corpus to refine attention mechanisms. Specifically, we iteratively conduct sentiment predictions on all training instances. Particularly, at each iteration, the context word with the maximum attention weight is extracted as the one with active/misleading influence on the correct/incorrect prediction of every instance, and then the word itself is masked for subsequent iterations. Finally, we augment the conventional training objective with a regularization term, which enables ASC models to continue equally focusing on the extracted active context words while decreasing weights of those misleading ones. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that our proposed approach yields better attention mechanisms, leading to substantial improvements over the two state-of-the-art neural ASC models.

In this paper, we propose a Transfer Capsule Network (TransCap) model for transferring document-level knowledge to aspect-level sentiment classification. To this end, we first develop an aspect routing approach to encapsulate the sentence-level semantic representations into semantic capsules from both the aspect-level and document-level data.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractWe propose a general strategy named ‘divide, conquer and combine’ for multimodal fusion. Instead of directly fusing features at holistic level, we conduct fusion hierarchically so that both local and global interactions are considered for a comprehensive interpretation of multimodal embeddings. In the ‘divide’ and ‘conquer’ stages, we conduct local fusion by exploring the interaction of a portion of the aligned feature vectors across various modalities lying within a sliding window, which ensures that each part of multimodal embeddings are explored sufficiently. On its basis, global fusion is conducted in the ‘combine’ stage to explore the interconnection across local interactions, via an Attentive Bi-directional Skip-connected LSTM that directly connects distant local interactions and integrates two levels of attention mechanism. In this way, local interactions can exchange information sufficiently and thus obtain an overall view of multimodal information.

However, all existing approaches to GEC correct errors by considering a single sentence alone and ignoring crucial cross-sentence context.

In this paper, we address this serious limitation of existing approaches and improve strong neural encoder-decoder models by appropriately modeling wider contexts. We employ an auxiliary encoder that encodes previous sentences and incorporate the encoding in the decoder via attention and gating mechanisms.

Information retrieval and extraction help us cope with abundant information from diverse sources.

This paper develops a general framework for estimating the trustworthiness of information sources in an environment where multiple sources provide claims and supporting evidence, and each claim can potentially be produced by multiple sources. We consider two settings: one in which information sources directly assert claims, and a more realistic and challenging one, in which claims are inferred from evidence provided by sources, via (possibly noisy) NLP techniques. Our key contribution is to develop a family of probabilistic models that jointly estimate the trustworthiness of sources, and the credibility of claims they assert. This is done while accounting for the (possibly noisy) NLP needed to infer claims from evidence supplied by sources.

This work uses neural text simplification methods to automatically improve the understandability of clinical letters for patients. We take existing neural text simplification software and augment it with a new phrase table that links complex medical terminology to simpler vocabulary by mining SNOMED-CT. In an evaluation task using crowdsourcing, we show that the results of our new system are ranked easier to understand (average rank 1.93) than using the original system (2.34) without our phrase table. We also show improvement against baselines including the original text (2.79) and using the phrase table without the neural text simplification software (2.94).

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractText classification aims at mapping documents into a set of predefined categories. Supervised machine learning models have shown great success in this area but they require a large number of labeled documents to reach adequate accuracy. This is particularly true when the number of target categories is in the tens or the hundreds. In this work, we explore an unsupervised approach to classify documents into categories simply described by a label. The proposed method is inspired by the way a human proceeds in this situation: It draws on textual similarity between the most relevant words in each document and a dictionary of keywords for each category reflecting its semantics and lexical field. The novelty of our method hinges on the enrichment of the category labels through a combination of human expertise and language models, both generic and domain specific. Our experiments on 5 standard corpora show that the proposed method increases F1-score over relying solely on human expertise and can also be on par with simple supervised approaches. It thus provides a practical alternative to situations where low cost text categorization is needed, as we illustrate with our application to operational risk incidents classification.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1036,,Towards Unsupervised Text Classification Leveraging Experts and Word Embeddings,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1036/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractIn recent NLP research, a topic of interest is universal sentence encoding, sentence representations that can be used in any supervised task. At the word sequence level, fully attention-based models suffer from two problems: a quadratic increase in memory consumption with respect to the sentence length and an inability to capture and use syntactic information. Recursive neural nets can extract very good syntactic information by traversing a tree structure. To this end, we propose Tree Transformer, a model that captures phrase level syntax for constituency trees as well as word-level dependencies for dependency trees by doing recursive traversal only with attention. Evaluation of this model on four tasks gets noteworthy results compared to the standard transformer and LSTM-based models as well as tree-structured LSTMs. Ablation studies to find whether positional information is inherently encoded in the trees and which type of attention is suitable for doing the recursive traversal are provided.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1030,,You Only Need Attention to Traverse Trees,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1030/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Second, incorporating pre-trained encoder representations into neural parsers substantially improves their performance across all domains, but does not give a larger relative improvement for out-of-domain treebanks.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractPersonalized news recommendation is important to help users find their interested news and improve reading experience. A key problem in news recommendation is learning accurate user representations to capture their interests. Users usually have both long-term preferences and short-term interests. However, existing news recommendation methods usually learn single representations of users, which may be insufficient. In this paper, we propose a neural news recommendation approach which can learn both long- and short-term user representations. The core of our approach is a news encoder and a user encoder. In the news encoder, we learn representations of news from their titles and topic categories, and use attention network to select important words. In the user encoder, we propose to learn long-term user representations from the embeddings of their IDs.In addition, we propose to learn short-term user representations from their recently browsed news via GRU network. Besides, we propose two methods to combine long-term and short-term user representations. The first one is using the long-term user representation to initialize the hidden state of the GRU network in short-term user representation. The second one is concatenating both long- and short-term user representations as a unified user vector.

To fulfill this gap, we propose a new model called DihEdral, named after dihedral symmetry group. This new model learns knowledge graph embeddings that can capture relation compositions by nature. Furthermore, our approach models the relation embeddings parametrized by discrete values, thereby decrease the solution space drastically.

Together, we obtain large improvements over the previous state-of-the-art in unsupervised machine translation. For instance, we get 22.5 BLEU points in English-to-German WMT 2014, 5.5 points more than the previous best unsupervised system, and 0.5 points more than the (supervised) shared task winner back in 2014.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1019,,An Effective Approach to Unsupervised Machine Translation,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1019/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

While most prior work has used a single source model or a few carefully selected models, here we consider a “massive” setting with many such models. This setting raises the problem of poor transfer, particularly from distant languages. We propose two techniques for modulating the transfer, suitable for zero-shot or few-shot learning, respectively.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractUnsupervised neural machine translation (NMT) has attracted a lot of attention recently. While state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised translation usually perform well between similar languages (e.g., English-German translation), they perform poorly between distant languages, because unsupervised alignment does not work well for distant languages. In this work, we introduce unsupervised pivot translation for distant languages, which translates a language to a distant language through multiple hops, and the unsupervised translation on each hop is relatively easier than the original direct translation. We propose a learning to route (LTR) method to choose the translation path between the source and target languages. LTR is trained on language pairs whose best translation path is available and is applied on the unseen language pairs for path selection. Experiments on 20 languages and 294 distant language pairs demonstrate the advantages of the unsupervised pivot translation for distant languages, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed LTR for path selection. Specifically, in the best case, LTR achieves an improvement of 5.58 BLEU points over the conventional direct unsupervised method.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1017,,Unsupervised Pivot Translation for Distant Languages,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1017/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

We propose a technique to quantitatively estimate this assumption of the isometry between two embedding spaces and empirically show that this assumption weakens as the languages in question become increasingly etymologically distant. We then propose Bilingual Lexicon Induction with Semi-Supervision (BLISS) — a semi-supervised approach that relaxes the isometric assumption while leveraging both limited aligned bilingual lexicons and a larger set of unaligned word embeddings, as well as a novel hubness filtering technique. Our proposed method obtains state of the art results on 15 of 18 language pairs on the MUSE dataset, and does particularly well when the embedding spaces don’t appear to be isometric.

This setting occurs when various datasets are created using different annotation schemes. This is also the case of extending a tag-set with a new tag by annotating only the new tag in a new dataset. We propose to use the given tag hierarchy to jointly learn a neural network that shares its tagging layer among all tag-sets.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractWord embeddings are widely used on a variety of tasks and can substantially improve the performance. However, their quality is not consistent throughout the vocabulary due to the long-tail distribution of word frequency. Without sufficient contexts, rare word embeddings are usually less reliable than those of common words. However, current models typically trust all word embeddings equally regardless of their reliability and thus may introduce noise and hurt the performance. Since names often contain rare and uncommon words, this problem is particularly critical for name tagging. In this paper, we propose a novel reliability-aware name tagging model to tackle this issue. We design a set of word frequency-based reliability signals to indicate the quality of each word embedding. Guided by the reliability signals, the model is able to dynamically select and compose features such as word embedding and character-level representation using gating mechanisms. For example, if an input word is rare, the model relies less on its word embedding and assigns higher weights to its character and contextual features. Experiments on OntoNotes 5.0 show that our model outperforms the baseline model by 2.7% absolute gain in F-score. In cross-genre experiments on five genres in OntoNotes, our model improves the performance for most genre pairs and obtains up to 5% absolute F-score gain.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1016,,Reliability-aware Dynamic Feature Composition for Name Tagging,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1016/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

In this paper we aim to answer the question: How much structural context are the BiLSTM representations able to capture implicitly? We show that features drawn from partial subtrees become redundant when the BiLSTMs are used.

In this paper, we propose four different strategies to transform continuous and generic sentence embeddings into a binarized form, while preserving their rich semantic information. The introduced methods are evaluated across a wide range of downstream tasks, where the binarized sentence embeddings are demonstrated to degrade performance by only about 2% relative to their continuous counterparts, while reducing the storage requirement by over 98%. Moreover, with the learned binary representations, the semantic relatedness of two sentences can be evaluated by simply calculating their Hamming distance, which is more computational efficient compared with the inner product operation between continuous embeddings.

Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/P19-1/,2019,"AbstractResponse selection plays an important role in fully automated dialogue systems. Given the dialogue context, the goal of response selection is to identify the best-matched next utterance (i.e., response) from multiple candidates. Despite the efforts of many previous useful models, this task remains challenging due to the huge semantic gap and also the large size of candidate set. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Matching network (STM) for response selection. In detail, soft alignment is first used to obtain the local relevance between the context and the response. And then, we construct spatio-temporal features by aggregating attention images in time dimension and make use of 3D convolution and pooling operations to extract matching information. Evaluation on two large-scale multi-turn response selection tasks has demonstrated that our proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art model.

This game between a primal model (semantic parsing) and a dual model (logical form to query) forces them to regularize each other, and can achieve feedback signals from some prior-knowledge. By utilizing the prior-knowledge of logical form structures, we propose a novel reward signal at the surface and semantic levels which tends to generate complete and reasonable logical forms.

We experiment with 10 different types of perturbations on 4 multi-turn dialog datasets and find that commonly used neural dialog architectures like recurrent and transformer-based seq2seq models are rarely sensitive to most perturbations such as missing or reordering utterances, shuffling words, etc. Also, by open-sourcing our code, we believe that it will serve as a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating dialog systems in the future.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1004,,Do Neural Dialog Systems Use the Conversation History Effectively?

In particular, people study the problem by investigating context-response matching for multi-turn response selection based on publicly recognized benchmark data sets.

In this work, we let utterance-response interaction go deep by proposing an interaction-over-interaction network (IoI). The model performs matching by stacking multiple interaction blocks in which residual information from one time of interaction initiates the interaction process again. Thus, matching information within an utterance-response pair is extracted from the interaction of the pair in an iterative fashion, and the information flows along the chain of the blocks via representations. Evaluation results on three benchmark data sets indicate that IoI can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of various matching metrics.

Proceedings of the Australasian Language Technology Association Workshop 2018,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/U18-1/,2018,"AbstractCluster labeling is the assignment of representative labels to clusters obtained from the organization of a document collection. Once assigned, the labels can play an important role in applications such as navigation, search and document classification. However, finding appropriately descriptive labels is still a challenging task. In this paper, we propose various approaches for assigning labels to word clusters by leveraging word embeddings and the synonymity and hypernymy relations in the WordNet lexical ontology. Experiments carried out using the WebAP document dataset have shown that one of the approaches stand out in the comparison and is capable of selecting labels that are reasonably aligned with those chosen by a pool of four human annotators.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/U18-1008,,Cluster Labeling by Word Embeddings and WordNet's Hypernymy,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/U/U18/U18-1008/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the Australasian Language Technology Association Workshop 2018,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/U18-1/,2018,"AbstractIn spite of the recent success of Dialogue Act (DA) classification, the majority of prior works focus on text-based classification with oracle transcriptions, i.e. human transcriptions, instead of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)’s transcriptions. In spoken dialog systems, however, the agent would only have access to noisy ASR transcriptions, which may further suffer performance degradation due to domain shift. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of using both acoustic and textual signals, either oracle or ASR transcriptions, and investigate speaker domain adaptation for DA classification. Our multimodal model proves to be superior to the unimodal models, particularly when the oracle transcriptions are not available. We also propose an effective method for speaker domain adaptation, which achieves competitive results.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/U18-1007,,Exploring Textual and Speech information in Dialogue Act Classification with Speaker Domain Adaptation,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/U/U18/U18-1007/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

Proceedings of the Australasian Language Technology Association Workshop 2018,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/U18-1/,2018,"AbstractAccurate evaluation of translation has long been a difficult, yet important problem. Current evaluations use direct assessment (DA), based on crowd sourcing judgements from a large pool of workers, along with quality control checks, and a robust method for combining redundant judgements. In this paper we show that the quality control mechanism is overly conservative, which increases the time and expense of the evaluation. We propose a model that does not rely on a pre-processing step to filter workers and takes into account varying annotator reliabilities. Our model effectively weights each worker's scores based on the inferred precision of the worker, and is much more reliable than the mean of either the raw scores or the standardised scores. We also show that DA does not deliver on the promise of longitudinal evaluation, and propose redesigning the structure of the annotation tasks that can solve this problem.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/U18-1010,,Towards Efficient Machine Translation Evaluation by Modelling Annotators,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/U/U18/U18-1010/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/
Proceedings of the Australasian Language Technology Association Workshop 2018,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/U18-1/,2018,"AbstractIt has been demonstrated that vector-based representations of words trained on large text corpora encode linguistic regularities that may be exploited via the use of vector space arithmetic. This capability has been extensively explored and is generally measured via tasks which involve the automated completion of linguistic proportional analogies. The question remains, however, as to what extent it is possible to induce relations from word embeddings in a principled and systematic way, without the provision of exemplars or seed terms. In this paper we propose an extensible and efficient framework for inducing relations via the use of constraint satisfaction. The method is efficient, unsupervised and can be customized in various ways.

Proceedings of the Australasian Language Technology Association Workshop 2018,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/U18-1/,2018,AbstractThe key activity to design an information system is conceptual modelling which brings out and describes the general knowledge that is required to build a system. In this paper we propose a novel approach to conceptual modelling where the domain experts will be able to specify and construct a model using a restricted form of natural language. A restricted natural language is a subset of a natural language that has well-defined computational properties and therefore can be translated unambiguously into a formal notation. We will argue that a restricted natural language is suitable for writing precise and consistent specifications that lead to executable conceptual models. Using a restricted natural language will allow the domain experts to describe a scenario in the terminology of the application domain without the need to formally encode this scenario. The resulting textual specification can then be automatically translated into the language of the desired conceptual modelling framework.,,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/U18-1005,,Specifying Conceptual Models Using Restricted Natural Language,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/U/U18/U18-1005/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

In contrast to traditional template driven extraction systems, we introduce a content-driven machine-learning approach which is both robust to noise and generalises to unseen document formats.

Proceedings of the Australasian Language Technology Association Workshop 2018,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/U18-1/,2018,"AbstractAmong the more typical forensic voice comparison (FVC) approaches, the acoustic-phonetic statistical approach is suitable for text-dependent FVC, but it does not fully exploit available time-varying information of speech in its modelling. The automatic approach, on the other hand, essentially deals with text-independent cases, which means temporal information is not explicitly incorporated in the modelling. Text-dependent likelihood ratio (LR)-based FVC studies, in particular those that adopt the automatic approach, are few. This preliminary LR-based FVC study compares two statistical models, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), for the calculation of forensic LRs using the same speech data. FVC experiments were carried out using different lengths of Japanese short words under a forensically realistic, but challenging condition: only two speech tokens for model training and LR estimation. Log-likelihood-ratio cost (Cllr) was used as the assessment metric. The study demonstrates that the HMM system constantly outperforms the GMM system in terms of average Cllr values. However, words longer than three mora are needed if the advantage of the HMM is to become evident. With a seven-mora word, for example, the HMM outperformed the GMM by a Cllr value of 0.073.",,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/U18-1002,,Text-dependent Forensic Voice Comparison: Likelihood Ratio Estimation with the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Gaussian Mixture Model,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/U/U18/U18-1002/,,ALTA,conf,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/alta/

However, it may be difficult for users who are not familiar with Semantic Web technologies to write a SPARQL query. Therefore, assisting users to build SPARQL queries is important task to expand the range of users of RDF databases. We developed a web application called SPARQL Builder (http://sparqlbuilder.org/) that enables users to access life-science RDF datasets by assisting them in writing SPARQL queries. One of the key technologies used in SPARQL Builder is to extract possible relationships in an RDF dataset between two classes of input and output data. We express such relationships by paths on a labeled graph called class graph representing class–predicate–class relations in a dataset. In addition, we present an efficient algorithm to compute all the possible paths between two classes on a class graph. To show the performance of the proposed algorithm, we compared our algorithm with a naive method using RDF datasets of various class sizes and confirmed that our algorithm runs much faster when the numbers of classes and relations are relatively large.",,,,,,Efficiently Finding Paths Between Classes to Build a SPARQL Query for Life-Science Databases,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-31676-5_24,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

Some systems have adopted IR (Information Retrieval) approaches to index and search the Semantic Web data due to its capability to handle the Web-scale data and efficiency on query answering. Additionally, the huge volumes of data on the Semantic Web are frequently updated. Thus, it further requires effective update mechanisms for these systems to handle the data change. However, the existing update approaches only focus on document. It still remains a big challenge to update IR index specially designed for semantic data in the form of finer grained structured objects rather than unstructured documents. In this paper, we present a well-designed update mechanism on the IR index for triples. Our approach provides a flexible and effective update mechanism by dividing the index into blocks. It reduces the number of update operations during the insertion of triples. At the same time, it preserves the efficiency on query processing and the capability to handle large scale semantic data. Experimental results show that the index update time is a fraction of that by complete reconstruction w.r.t. the portion of the inserted triples. Moreover, the query response time is not notably affected.

In this study, we developed a specified version of the LOD Surfer for the annotation of multiple protein sequence alignment. The system comprised a web application programming interface (API) and a client system for the API. The web API provides a list of classes, and a list of paths between the classes that are specified by a user. The client presents the list of classes and the list of paths obtained from the API and assists a user in selecting classes and paths to acquire the required annotation of proteins. Additionally, the client system generates SPARQL queries to execute a federated query search for a selected path. During the development of the system, we can observe that (1) the client system should display some instances with human readable information because class selection is not an easy task for biological researchers, and (2) it is preferable that the client system stores paths that are selected by a user for reuse by other users because path selection may be time consuming at times and because the selected paths may be valuable for other researchers.",,,,,,Implementing LOD Surfer as a Search System for the Annotation of Multiple Protein Sequence Alignment,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04284-4_29,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

In this paper, we investigate how to use ontologies to facilitate integrating and querying information on parallel leaf shape descriptions from NL documents.

In this paper we present a system that allows users: (a) to test and compare OWL reasoners using an extensible library of real-life ontologies; (b) to check the “correctness” of the reasoners by comparing the computed class hierarchy; (c) to compare the performance of the reasoners when performing this task; and (d) to use SQL queries to analyse and present the results in any way they see fit.",,,,,,Framework for an Automated Comparison of Description Logic Reasoners,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11926078_47,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

This paper aims at contributing to the alleviation of this situation by proposing ONTOCOM (Ontology Cost Model), a model to predict the costs arising in ontology engineering processes. We introduce a methodology to generate a cost model adapted to a particular ontology development strategy, and an inventory of cost drivers which influence the amount of effort invested in activities performed during an ontology life cycle. We further present the results of the model validation procedure, which covered an expert-driven evaluation and a statistical calibration on 36 data points collected from real-world projects. The validation revealed that ontology engineering processes have a high learning rate, indicating that the building of very large ontologies is feasible from an economic point of view.

Allowing, in addition, for an agent to express its preference for the satisfaction of certain rules over others, we can then induce a preference order on those strategies. However, since it is natural for an agent to believe its own knowledge (encoded in the program) but consider some sources more reliable than others, it can alternatively express preferences on call literals.

Based upon our experience in building an end-to-end composition tool for application integration, we bring out issues that have an impact on information modeling aspects of the composition process. In this paper, we present approaches for solving problems relating to scalability and manageability of service descriptions and data flow construction for operationalizing the composed services.",,,,,,Information Modeling for End to End Composition of Semantic Web Services,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11574620_35,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

One major difficulty is that, by its very nature, the Semantic Web is a large, uncensored system to which anyone may contribute. This raises the question of how much credence to give each source. We cannot expect each user to know the trustworthiness of each source, nor would we want to assign top-down or global credibility values due to the subjective nature of trust. We tackle this problem by employing a web of trust, in which each user maintains trusts in a small number of other users. We then compose these trusts into trust values for all other users. The result of our computation is not an agglomerate “trustworthiness"" of each user. Instead, each user receives a personalized set of trusts, which may vary widely from person to person. We define properties for combination functions which merge such trusts, and define a class of functions for which merging may be done locally while maintaining these properties. We give examples of specific functions and apply them to data from Epinions and our BibServ bibliography server.

In pervasive scenarios, however, collaborating entities cannot be predetermined and resource availability frequently varies, even unpredictably, due to user/device mobility, thus complicating resource access control. Access control policies cannot be defined based on entity’s identities/roles, as in traditional access control solutions, or be specified a priori to face any operative run time condition, but require continuous adjustments to adapt to the current situation. To address these issues, this paper advocates the adoption of novel access control policy models that follow two main design guidelines: context-awareness to control resource access on the basis of context visibility and to enable dynamic adaptation of policies depending on context changes, and semantic technologies for context/policy specification to allow high-level description and reasoning about context and policies.

Vertical composition consists of defining an appropriate combination of simple processes to perform a composition task. Horizontal composition process consists of determining the most appropriate Web service, from among a set of functionally equivalent ones for each component process. Several recent research efforts have dealt with the Web service composition problem. Nevertheless, most of them tackled only the vertical composition of Web services despite the growing trend towards functionally equivalent Web services. In an attempt to facilitate and streamline the process of horizontal composition of Web services while taking the above limitation into consideration, this work includes two main contributions.

Thus, the relationship between classes and properties can become hardly accessible by end users thus affecting the practical value of ontologies. Indeed, it is essential for end users to be able to navigate or browse through an ontology, to get a big picture of what classes there are and what they have in common in terms of other related classes and properties. This helps end users in effectively performing various knowledge engineering tasks such as querying and domain exploration.

As the matching strategies adopted are largely heuristic, wrong mappings often exist in alignments generated by ontology matching systems. The mainstream methods for mapping revision deal with logical inconsistencies, so erroneous mappings not causing an inconsistency may be left out. Therefore, manual validations from domain experts are required. In this paper, we propose a graph-based method for interactive mapping revision with the purpose of reducing manual efforts as much as possible. Source ontologies are encoded into an integrated graph, where its mapping arcs are obtained by transforming mappings and will be evaluated by the expert. We specify the decision space for mapping revision and the corresponding operations that can be applied in the graph. After a human decision is made in each interaction, the mappings entailed by the manually confirmed ones are automatically approved. Conversely, those that would entail the rejected mappings or make the graph incoherent are declined. The whole update process modeled in the decision space can be done in polynomial time. Moreover, we define an impact function based on the integrated graph to identify the most influential mappings that will be displayed to the expert. In this way, the efforts of manual evaluation could be reduced further.

The semantic labels could be numerical properties in ontologies, instances in knowledge bases, or labeled data that are manually annotated by domain experts. In this paper, we refer to semantic labeling as a retrieval setting where the label of an unknown attribute is assigned by the label of the most relevant attribute in labeled data. One of the greatest challenges is that an unknown attribute rarely has the same set of values with the similar one in the labeled data. To overcome the issue, statistical interpretation of value distribution is taken into account. However, the existing studies assume a specific form of distribution. It is not appropriate in particular to apply open data where there is no knowledge of data in advance. To address these problems, we propose a neural numerical embedding model (EmbNum) to learn useful representation vectors for numerical attributes without prior assumptions on the distribution of data.

To alleviate the selection burden, this paper studies automatic methods for ranking diagnoses so that people can merely focus on top diagnoses when seeking the best one.

Given a set of diagnoses, the approach first learns the embedding of the complement set of the union of all diagnoses, then for every diagnosis, incrementally learns an embedding of the complement set of the diagnosis and employs the embedding to estimate the removal cost of the diagnosis, and finally ranks diagnoses by removal costs. To evaluate the approach, four knowledge graphs with logical theories are constructed from the four great classical masterpieces of Chinese literature.

With the continuing proliferation of structured data, demand for RDF compression is becoming increasingly important. In this study, we introduce a novel lossless compression technique for RDF datasets (triples), called PIC (Predicate Invention based Compression). By generating informative predicates and constructing effective mapping to original predicates, PIC only needs to store dramatically reduced number of triples with the newly created predicates, and restoring the original triples efficiently using the mapping.

With the current development of the technology and moving learning material into the web environment it acquired a new dimension. Learning objects are the chunks of knowledge shared by e-learning community. Organizations and individuals are building repositories of learning objects and annotate them with metadata to describe their educational values and standardization efforts are on the way to provide a franca lingua for the educators. In this paper we describe the peer-to-peer infrastructure for sharing learning object we are building in Canada. The POOL projects builds on the three types of nodes: SPLASH is an freely downloadable application which allows individuals to create metadata and maintain their collection of learning objects, PONDs are bigger repositories of learning objects connected to the peer-to-peer network and POOL centrals increase the speed and breadth of the searches in the peer-to-peer network. The POOL project uses CanCore - a subset of the IMS metadata protocol - to describe learning objects. In the second part of the paper we discuss the future direction of this initiative based on the maturing learning objects community and lessons learned in the deployment of POOL network. We argue that the standardization effort, although very important, currently provides solutions that are too complex.

The method generalizes to virtually any system, a claim which we illustrate by describing our program, PDDAML, which encodes domain specifications in PDDL using our technique.

Also, a very specific vocabulary has evolved, in particular in the SAP domain (e.g. SAP Solution Maps or SAP software module names). This vocabulary is not clearly mapped to business management terminology and concepts. It is a well-known problem in practice that searching in SAP ERP documentation is difficult, because it requires in-depth knowledge of a large and proprietary terminology. We propose to use ontologies and automatic annotation of such large HTML software documentation in order to improve the usability and accessibility, namely of ERP help files. In order to achieve that, we have developed an ontology and prototype for SAP ERP 6.0. Our approach integrates concepts and lexical resources from (1) business management terminology, (2) SAP business terminology, (3) SAP system terminology, and (4) Wordnet synsets. We use standard GATE/KIM technology to annotate SAP help documentation with respective references to our ontology. Eventually, our approach consolidates the knowledge contained in the SAP help functionality at a conceptual level. This allows users to express their queries using a terminology they are familiar with, e.g. referring to general management terms. Despite a widely automated ontology construction process and a simplistic annotation strategy with minimal human intervention, we experienced convincing results.

A more systematic characterization and validation of tag similarity in terms of formal representations of knowledge is still lacking. Here we address this issue and analyze several measures of tag similarity: Each measure is computed on data from the social bookmarking system del.icio.us and a semantic grounding is provided by mapping pairs of similar tags in the folksonomy to pairs of synsets in Wordnet, where we use validated measures of semantic distance to characterize the semantic relation between the mapped tags.

The majority of currently existing approaches focuses on centralized architectures, and deals with efficiency typically by pre-computing and storing the results of the semantic matcher for all possible query concepts. Such approaches, however, fail to scale with respect to the number of service advertisements and the size of the ontologies involved. On the other hand, this paper presents an efficient and scalable index-based method for Semantic Web service discovery that allows for fast selection of services at query time and is suitable for both centralized and P2P environments. We employ a novel encoding of the service descriptions, allowing the match between a request and an advertisement to be evaluated in constant time, and we index these representations to prune the search space, reducing the number of comparisons required. Given a desired ranking function, the search algorithm can retrieve the top-k matches progressively, i.e., better matches are computed and returned first, thereby further reducing the search engine’s response time. We also show how this search can be performed efficiently in a suitable structured P2P overlay network.

If collections are annotated according to two systems, e.g. with tags and keywords, the annotated data can be used for instance based mapping between the vocabularies. The basis for this kind of matching is an appropriate similarity measure between concepts, based on their distribution as annotations. In this paper we propose a new similarity measure that can take advantage of some special properties of user generated metadata. We have evaluated this measure with a set of articles from Wikipedia which are both classified according to the topic structure of Wikipedia and annotated by users of the bookmarking service del.icio.us. The results using the new measure are significantly better than those obtained using standard similarity measures proposed for this task in the literature, i.e., it correlates better with human judgments.

Since justifications respect the syntactic form of axioms in an ontology, they are usually neither syntactically nor semantically minimal. This paper presents two new subclasses of justifications—laconic justifications and precise justifications. Laconic justifications only consist of axioms that do not contain any superfluous “parts”. Precise justifications can be derived from laconic justifications and are characterised by the fact that they consist of flat, small axioms, which facilitate the generation of semantically minimal repairs. Formal definitions for both types of justification are presented. In contrast to previous work in this area, these definitions make it clear as to what exactly “parts of axioms” are. In order to demonstrate the practicability of computing laconic, and hence precise justifications, an algorithm is provided and results from an empirical evaluation carried out on several published ontologies are presented. The evaluation showed that laconic/precise justifications can be computed in a reasonable time for entailments in a range of ontologies that vary in size and complexity. It was found that in half of the ontologies sampled there were entailments that had more laconic/precise justifications than regular justifications. More surprisingly it was observed that for some ontologies there were fewer laconic justifications than regular justifications.",,,,,,Laconic and Precise Justifications in OWL,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-88564-1_21,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

Towards this end, we define a framework that uses a DL reasoner to reason over the TBox of the ontology (hybrid-like) and a rule engine to apply a domain-specific version of ABox-related entailments (homogeneous-like) that are generated by TBox queries to the DL reasoner.

In earlier papers, we have proposed the use of syntactic relevance functions as a method for reasoning with inconsistent ontologies.

The OWL Services (OWL-S) ontology is an upper ontology in OWL language, providing essential vocabularies to semantically describe Web services. Currently OWL-S services can only be developed independently; if one service is unavailable then finding a suitable alternative would require an expensive and difficult global search/match. It is desirable to have a new OWL-S construct that can systematically support substitution tracing as well as incremental development and reuse of services. Introducing inheritance relationship (IR) into OWL-S is a natural solution. However, OWL-S, as well as most of the other currently discussed formalisms for Semantic Web Services such as WSMO or SAWSDL, has yet to define a concrete and self-contained mechanism of establishing inheritance relationships among services, which we believe is very important for the automated annotation and discovery of Web services as well as human organization of services into a taxonomy-like structure. In this paper, we extend OWL-S with the ability to define and maintain inheritance relationships between services. Through the definition of an additional “inheritance profile”, inheritance relationships can be stated and reasoned about. Two types of IRs are allowed to grant service developers the choice to respect the “contract” between services or not.

However, many of the ontologies that are developed with reuse in mind, such as standard reference ontologies and controlled terminologies, are extremely large, while the users often need to reuse only a small part of these resources in their work. Specifying various views of an ontology enables users to limit the set of concepts that they see. In this paper, we develop the concept of a Traversal View, a view where a user specifies the central concept or concepts of interest, the relationships to traverse to find other concepts to include in the view, and the depth of the traversal. For example, given a large ontology of anatomy, a user may use a Traversal View to extract a concept of Heart and organs and organ parts that surround the heart or are contained in the heart. We define the notion of Traversal Views formally, discuss their properties, present a strategy for maintaining the view through ontology evolution and describe our tool for defining and extracting Traversal Views.",,,,,,Specifying Ontology Views by Traversal,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30475-3_49,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

A number of tools already exist as evidenced by the ten systems participating in the W3C’s evaluation of the OWL Test Cases. For the most part, these first generation tools focus on experimental approaches to consistency checking, while minimal attention is paid to how the results will be used or how the systems might interoperate. For this reason very few of these systems produce results in a machine-readable format (for example as OWL annotations) and there is no shared notion across the tools of how to identify and describe what it is that makes a specific ontology or annotation inconsistent. In this paper we propose the development of a Symptom Ontology for the Semantic Web that would serve as a common language for identifying and describing semantic errors and warnings that may be indicative of inconsistencies in ontologies and annotations; we refer to such errors and warnings as symptoms. We offer the symptom ontology currently used by the ConsVISor consistency-checking tool, as the starting point for a discussion on the desirable characteristics of such an ontology. Included among these characteristics are 1) a hierarchy of common symptoms, 2) clear associations between specific symptoms and the axioms of the languages they violate and 3) a means for relating individual symptoms back to the specific constructs in the input file(s) through which they were implicated.

An important aspect of Magpie, which differentiates it from superficially similar hypermedia systems, is that the association between items on a web page and semantic concepts is not merely a mechanism for dynamic linking, but it is the enabling condition for locating services and making them available to a user. These services can be manually activated by a user (pull services), or opportunistically triggered when the appropriate web entities are encountered during a browsing session (push services). In this paper we analyze Magpie from the perspective of building semantic web applications and we note that earlier implementations did not fulfill the criterion of “open as to services”, which is a key aspect of the emerging semantic web. For this reason, in the past twelve months we have carried out a radical redesign of Magpie, resulting in a novel architecture, which is open both with respect to ontologies and semantic web services.

OWL provides the owl:imports construct which, roughly, allows Web ontologies to include other Web ontologies, but only by merging all the linked ontologies into a single logical “space.” Recent work on multidimensional logics, fusions and other combinations of modal logics, distributed and contextual logics, and the like have tried to find formalisms wherein knowledge bases (and their logic) are kept more distinct but yet affect each other. These formalisms have various degrees of robustness in their computational complexity, their modularity, their expressivity, and their intuitiveness to modelers. In this paper, we explore a family of such formalisms, grounded in \(\mathcal{E}\)-connections as extensions to OWL, with emphasis on a novel sub-formalism that seems very straightforward to implement on existing tableau OWL reasoners, as witnessed by our implementation of this formalism in the OWL reasoner Pellet.

It supports isolated service integration sessions providing a consistent view of the directory data.

Using these rules, the system is able to analyze the visual features of any given image from this domain and generate semantically meaningful labels, using terms defined in the domain-specific ontology.

ASSAM is also relevant for service producers who have deployed a Web Service and want to make it compatible with an existing ontology. ASSAM’s capabilities to automatically create semantic metadata are supported by two machine learning algorithms. First, we have developed an iterative relational classification algorithm for semantically classifying Web Services, their operations, and input and output messages. Second, to aggregate the data returned by multiple semantically related Web Services, we have developed a schema mapping algorithm that is based on an ensemble of string distance metrics.",,,,,,ASSAM: A Tool for Semi-automatically Annotating Semantic Web Services,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30475-3_23,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

Traditional versioning systems enable users to compare versions, examine changes, and accept or reject changes. However, while versioning systems usually treat software code and text documents as text files, a versioning system for ontologies must compare and present structural changes rather than changes in text representation of ontologies. In this paper, we present the PromptDiff ontology-versioning environment, which address these challenges. PromptDiff includes an efficient version-comparison algorithm that produces a structural diff between ontologies. The results are presented to the users through an intuitive user interface for analyzing the changes that enables users to view concepts and groups of concepts that were added, deleted, and moved, distinguished by their appearance and with direct access to additional information characterizing the change. The users can then act on the changes, accepting or rejecting them. We present results of a pilot user study that demonstrate the effectiveness of the tool for change management.

Therefore ontologies are unlikely to identify every useful or interesting classification possible in a problem domain, for example these might be of a personalised nature and only appropriate for a certain user in a certain context, or they might be of a different granularity than the initial scope of the ontology. We argue that machine learning techniques will be essential within the Semantic Web context to allow these unspecified classifications to be identified. In this paper we explore the application of machine learning methods to FOAF, highlighting the challenges posed by the characteristics of such data. Specifically, we use clustering to identify classes of people and inductive logic programming (ILP) to learn descriptions of these groups. We argue that these descriptions constitute re-usable, first class knowledge that is neither explicitly stated nor deducible from the input data.

For instance, how can templates concisely represent a broad range of potential uses, yet ensure that each possible instantiation will function properly? And how does the agent explain its actions to the humans involved? This paper addresses these challenges in the context of a case study carried out on our fully-deployed system for semantic email agents. We describe how high-level features of our template language enable the concise specification of flexible goals. In response to the first question, we show that it is possible to verify, in polynomial time, that a given template will always produce a valid instantiation.

The physical layer is used to implement various functions at the logical layer, including attribute-based search, schema management and schema mapping management. The separation of a physical from a logical layer allows us to process logical operations in the semantic overlay using different physical execution strategies. In particular we identify iterative and recursive strategies for the traversal of semantic overlay networks as two important alternatives.

By leveraging redundancies among competitor information in lists, tables, and texts, these competitors are fed as seeds to distantly supervise the learning process to find table columns and text patterns containing competitors. The whole process is iteratively performed. In each iteration, the newly discovered competitors of high confidence from various sources are treated as new seeds for bootstrapping. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach without human intentions and external knowledge bases. Moreover, the approach significantly outperforms traditional named entity recognition approaches.",,,,,,A Multi-strategy Learning Approach to Competitor Identification,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-15615-6_15,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

Detecting changes in RDF data is important to support Linked Data consuming applications with version management. Traditional approaches for change detection are not scalable. This has led researchers to devise algorithms on the MapReduce framework. Most works simply take a URI as a Map key. We observed that it is not efficient to handle RDF data with a large number of distinct URIs since many Reduce tasks have to be created. Even though the Reduce tasks are scheduled to run simultaneously, too many small Reduce tasks would increase the overall running time. In this paper, we propose G-Diff, an efficient MapReduce algorithm for RDF change detection.

The first approach provides very fast responses but with low-quality because changes of original data are not immediately reflected on materialized data. The second approach provides accurate responses but it is notorious for long response times. A hybrid SPARQL query processor provides a middle ground between two specified extremes by splitting the triple patterns of SPARQL query between live and local processors based on a predetermined coherence threshold specified by the administrator. Considering quality requirements while splitting the SPARQL query, enables the processor to eliminate the unnecessary live execution and releases resources for other queries. This requires estimating the quality of response provided with current materialized data, compare it with user requirements and determine the most selective sub-queries which can boost the response quality up to the specified level with least computational complexity.

The state-of-the-art approach ignores the open-world nature of linked data and involves a time-consuming step of preparing the input for the rule-miner. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a schema-agnostic unsupervised method to discover inverse and symmetric axioms from linked datasets. For mining inverse property axioms, we find that other than support and confidence scores, a new factor called predicate-preference factor (ppf) is useful and setting an appropriate threshold on ppf helps in mining quality axioms. We also introduce a novel mechanism, which also takes into account the semantic-similarity of predicates to rank-order candidate axioms. Using experimental evaluation, we show that our method discovers potential axioms with good accuracy.",,,,,,Mining Inverse and Symmetric Axioms in Linked Data,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-70682-5_14,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

Therefore, we detect locations with high possibility of bicycle accidents using user participatory sensing and offer them drivers and government officials as Open Hazard Data (OHD) to prevent future bicycle accident. This paper uses smartphone sensors to obtain data for acceleration, location, and handle rotation information. Then, by classifying those data with convolutional neural networks, it was confirmed that the locations, where sudden braking occurred can be detected with an accuracy of 80%.

Social media, such as Sina Weibo, reflects the general public’s stances towards different issues. Detecting and summarizing stances towards specific issues from social media is an important and challenging task. Although stance detection on social media has been studied before, previous work, most of which are based on supervised learning, may not work well because they suffer from its heavy dependence on training data. Other weakly supervised method also use some heuristic rules to select the posts with specific stances as training data, but these selected posts often concentrate on a few subtopics of the specific issue, these weakly supervised method can only train a biased stance classifier. To better detect stances toward specific issues, we consider to detect stances with a small number of labeled training data and a mass of unlabeled data. To integrate the supervised information into our model, we combine a discriminative maximum entropy (Max-Ent) component with the generative component. The Max-Ent component leverages hand-crafted features from labeled data to separate different stances. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised topic model, Semi-Supervised Stance Topic Model (SSTM), that model stances and topics of the posts on social media. Since the posts on social media are short texts, we also incorporate the structural information of the posts, i.e., gender information, location information and time information, to aggregate posts for alleviating the context sparsity of the posts. The model has been evaluated on the selected posts on sina weibo, which talk about “the verbal battle of Han han and Fang zhouzi”, to classify the stance of each posts.

Dietary menu planning for diabetic patients is a complicated tasks involving specific and common-sense knowledge. Case-based approach has been used to provide recommendation in the case where ratings were not easily available for domains such as menu planning. Among the important but yet difficult tasks in the case-based approach is case adaptation. To successfully support case adaptation, the constraint-based approach and food composition ontology were employed. Constraints knowledge were represented as production rules and exploits the food ontology to support adaptation. An ontological approach is also proposed to perform the inference process to satisfy the multiple design constraints.

Linked data is one of the most successful practices in semantic web, which has led to the opening and interlinking of data. Though many agents (mostly academic organizations and government) have published a large amount of linked data, numerous agents such as private companies and industries either do not have the ability or do not want to make an additional effort to publish linked data. Thus, for agents who are willing to open part of their data but do not want to make an effort, the task can be undertaken by a professional third-party server (together with professional experts) that publishes linked data for these agents. Consequently, when a single third-party server is on behalf of multiple agents, it is also responsible to organize these multiple-source URIs (data) in a systematic way to make them referable, satisfying the 4-star data principles, as well as protect the confidential data of these agents. In this paper, we propose a framework to leverage these challenges and design a URI standard based on our proposed E-RDF, which extends and optimizes the existing 5-star linked data principles. Also, we introduce a customized data filtering mechanism to protect the confidential data. For validation, we implement a prototype system as a third-party server that publishes linked data for a number of agents. It demonstrates well-organized 5-star linked data plus E-RDF and shows the additional advantages of data integration and interlinking among agents.

We assume that factual information about known individuals (i.e., individuals whose identity is known) and anonymous individuals is stored in an ABox and general background information is expressed in a TBox, where both the TBox and the ABox are publicly accessible. The identity problem then asks whether one can deduce from the TBox and the ABox that a given anonymous individual is equal to a known one. Since this would reveal the identity of the anonymous individual, such a situation needs to be avoided. We first observe that not all Description Logics (DLs) are able to derive any such equalities between individuals, and thus the identity problem is trivial in these DLs. We then consider DLs with nominals, number restrictions, or function dependencies, in which the identity problem is non-trivial. We show that in these DLs the identity problem has the same complexity as the instance problem.

As the theoretical counterpart of fuzzy ontology languages, fuzzy Description Logics (DLs) have attracted a wide range of concerns. With the emergence of a great number of large-scale domain ontologies, the basic reasoning services cannot meet the need of dealing with complex queries (mainly conjunctive queries), which are indispensable in data-intensive applications. Conjunctive queries (CQs), originated from relational databases, play an important role as an expressive reasoning service for ontologies. Since, however, the negation of a role atom in a CQ is not expressible as a part of a knowledge base, existing tableau algorithms cannot be used directly to deal with the issue. In this paper, we thus present a tableau-based algorithm for deciding query entailment of fuzzy conjunctive queries w.r.t. fuzzy \(\mathcal{SHIN}\) ontologies. Moreover, the data complexity problem was still open for answering CQs in expressive fuzzy DLs. We tackle this issue by proving a tight coNP upper bound for the problem in f-\(\mathcal{SHIN}\), as long as only simple roles occur in the query.

Since, there is no knowledge on the sentences for the first instances, they are clustered using decision tree. Rules are formulated using pattern clusters.

The novelty is that the disambiguation process is incremental and includes several rounds that filter the candidates, by exploiting previously identified entities and extending the text by those entity attributes every time they are successfully resolved in a round. We test the performance of the proposed method in disambiguation of names of people, locations and organizations in texts of the news domain. The experiment results show that our approach achieves high accuracy and can be used to construct a robust named entity disambiguation system.",,,,,,Named Entity Disambiguation: A Hybrid Statistical and Rule-Based Incremental Approach,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-89704-0_29,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

A supervised rule learning algorithm is employed for automatic construction of information extraction rules from hand-tagged training symptom phrases.

Understanding key gene-related terms as well as their semantic relationships is essential for comprehending the conceptual structure of biomedical document collections and avoiding information overload for users. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called ‘GOClonto’ to automatically generate ontologies for conceptualization of biomedical document collections. Based on GO (Gene Ontology), GOClonto extracts gene-related terms from biomedical text, applies latent semantic analysis to identify key gene-related terms, allocates documents based on the key gene-related terms, and utilizes GO to automatically generate a corpus-related gene ontology. The experimental results show that GOClonto is able to identify key gene-related terms. For a test biomedical document collection, GOClonto shows better performance than other clustering algorithms in terms of F-measure.

One kind of important triples is about Wikipedia articles and their non-isa properties, e.g. (Beijing, country, China). Previous work has tried to extract such triples from Wikipedia infoboxes, article text and categories. The infobox-based and text-based extraction methods depend on the infoboxes and suffer from a low article coverage. In contrast, the category-based extraction methods exploit the widespread categories. However, they rely on predefined properties, which is too effort-consuming and explores only very limited knowledge in the categories. This paper automatically extracts properties and triples from the less explored Wikipedia categories so as to achieve a wider article coverage with less manual effort. We manage to realize this goal by utilizing the syntax and semantics brought by super-sub category pairs in Wikipedia. Our prototype implementation outputs about 10M triples with a 12-level confidence ranging from 47.0% to 96.4%, which cover 78.2% of Wikipedia articles.

A set of seed nodes, where each node represents a tag annotating a resource, is then selected and their quality is assessed. The quality of the remaining nodes is calculated by propagating the known quality of the seeds through the graph structure.

A natural strategy for dealing with this issue is to generate a summary of the vocabulary description that compactly carries its main theme and reveals its relevance to the user’s information need. In this paper, we present a new solution to this problem of vocabulary summarization, which has been defined as ranking and selecting RDF sentences in our previous work. Firstly, we propose a novel bipartite graph representation of vocabulary description, on which we carry out a stochastic analysis of a random surfer’s behavior, from which we derive a new centrality measure for RDF sentences called BipRank. Further, we improve it by investigating the patterns of RDF sentences and employing their statistical features. Then, we combine BipRank with query relevance and cohesion metrics into an aggregate objective function to be optimized for the selection of RDF sentences. Our experiments on real-world vocabularies demonstrate the superiority of our approach to the baseline, and also validate its scalability in practice.",,,,,,BipRank: Ranking and Summarizing RDF Vocabulary Descriptions,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-29923-0_15,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

In recent years, different data providers have produced many data sources in the Linking Open Data (LOD) cloud upon different schemas. Isolated published linked data sources are not themselves so beneficial for intelligent applications and agents in the context of semantic web. It is not possible to take advantage of the linked data potential capacity without integrating various data sources. The challenge of integration is not limited to instances; rather, schema heterogeneity affects discovering instances with the same identity. In this paper we propose a novel approach, SBUEI, for instance co-reference resolution between various linked data sources even with heterogeneous schemas. For this purpose, SBUEI considers the entity co-reference resolution problem in both schema and instance levels. The process of matching is applied in both levels consecutively to let the system discover identical instances. SBUEI also applies a new approach for consolidation of linked data in instance level. After finding identical instances, SBUEI searches locally around them in order to find more instances that are equal. Experiments show that SBUEI obtains promising results with high precision and recall.",,,,,,Instance Coreference Resolution in Multi-ontology Linked Data Resources,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-37996-3_9,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

So far, learning link specifications has been addressed by approaches that rely on standard similarity and distance measures such as the Levenshtein distance for strings and the Euclidean distance for numeric values. While these approaches have been shown to perform well, the use of standard similarity measure still hampers their accuracy, as several link discovery tasks can only be solved sub-optimally when relying on standard measures. In this paper, we address this drawback by presenting a novel approach to learning string similarity measures concurrently across multiple dimensions directly from labeled data. Our approach is based on learning linear classifiers which rely on learned edit distance within an active learning setting. By using this combination of paradigms, we can ensure that we reduce the labeling burden on the experts at hand while achieving superior results on datasets for which edit distances are useful. We evaluate our approach on three different real datasets and show that our approach can improve the accuracy of classifiers.

Measuring similarity between resources and identifying their relatedness could be used for various applications such as item-based recommender systems.

However, some fundamental axioms for similarity measures such as “equal self-similarity”, “symmetry” or “minimality” are violated, and property similarities have been ignored. Moreover, none of the previous studies have provided a comparative study on other similarity measures. In this paper, we present a similarity measure, called Resim (Resource Similarity), based on top of a revised LDSD similarity measure.

The goal of instance matching is to detect co-referent instances that refer to the same real-world objects. In order to realize such instances, instance matching systems use a configuration, which specifies the matching properties, similarity measures, and other settings of the matching process. For different repositories, the configuration is varied to adapt with the particular characteristics of the input. Therefore, the automation of configuration creation is very important. In this paper, we propose \(cLink\), a supervised instance matching system for linked data. \(cLink\) is enhanced by a heuristic algorithm that learns the optimal configuration on the basic of input repositories.

The importance and applicability of MD data warehouses over RDF is widely studied yet none of the works support a spatially enhanced MD model on the SW. Spatial support in DWs is a desirable feature for enhanced analysis, since adding encoded spatial information of the data allows to query with spatial functions. In this paper we propose to empower the spatial dimension of data warehouses by adding spatial data types and topological relationships to the existing QB4OLAP vocabulary, which already supports the representation of the constructs of the MD models in RDF. With QB4SOLAP, spatial constructs of the MD models can be also published in RDF, which allows to implement spatial and metric analysis on spatial members along with OLAP operations.

Currently, there already exist a number of different alignment strategies. However, it is usually difficult for a user that needs to align two ontologies to decide which of the different available strategies are the most suitable. In this paper we propose a method that provides recommendations on alignment strategies for a given alignment problem. The method is based on the evaluation of the different available alignment strategies on several small selected pieces from the ontologies, and uses the evaluation results to provide recommendations. In the paper we give the basic steps of the method, and then illustrate and discuss the method in the setting of an alignment problem with two well-known biomedical ontologies. We also experiment with different implementations of the steps in the method.",,,,,,A Method for Recommending Ontology Alignment Strategies,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-76298-0_36,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

The successful application of machine learning techniques for learning of ontologies from textual data, i.e. mining for the Semantic Web, contributes to this trend. However, no principal approaches exist so far for mining from the Semantic Web. We investigate how machine learning algorithms can be made amenable for directly taking advantage of the rich knowledge expressed in ontologies and associated instance data. Kernel methods have been successfully employed in various learning tasks and provide a clean framework for interfacing between non-vectorial data and machine learning algorithms. In this spirit, we express the problem of mining instances in ontologies as the problem of defining valid corresponding kernels. We present a principled framework for designing such kernels by means of decomposing the kernel computation into specialized kernels for selected characteristics of an ontology which can be flexibly assembled and tuned.

In our approach, Web services are semantically described using LAV mappings in terms of generic concepts from an ontology, user requests correspond to conjunctive queries on the generic concepts and, in addition, the user may specify a set of preferences that are used to rank the possible solutions to the given request. The LAV formulation allows us to cast the service selection problem as a query rewriting problem that must consider the relationships among the concepts in the ontology and the ranks induced by the preferences. Then, building on related work, we devise an encoding of the resulting query rewriting problem as a logical theory whose models are in correspondence with the solutions of the user request, and in presence of preferences, whose best models are in correspondence with the best-ranked solutions.

In our solutions, we need to address a few technical challenges. Firstly, computational-oriented fact checking is not comprehensive enough to cover all the relations needed for fake news detection. Secondly, it is challenging to validate the correctness of the extracted triples from news articles. Our approaches are evaluated with the Kaggle’s ‘Getting Real about Fake News’ dataset and some true articles from main stream media. The evaluations show that some of our approaches have over 0.80 F1-scores.",,,,,,Content Based Fake News Detection Using Knowledge Graphs,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00671-6_39,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

Despite this complexity, in this paper we propose an algorithm that performs syntactic canonicalisation of SPARQL queries such that the answers for the canonicalised query will not change versus the original. We can guarantee that the canonicalisation of two queries within a core fragment of SPARQL (monotone queries with select, project, join and union) is equal if and only if the two queries are equivalent; we also support other SPARQL features but with a weaker soundness guarantee: that the (partially) canonicalised query is equivalent to the input query. Despite the fact that canonicalisation must be harder than the equivalence problem, we show the algorithm to be practical for real-world queries taken from SPARQL endpoint logs, and further show that it detects more equivalent queries than when compared with purely syntactic methods. We also present the results of experiments over synthetic queries designed to stress-test the canonicalisation method, highlighting difficult cases.",,,,,,Canonicalisation of Monotone SPARQL Queries,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00671-6_35,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

However, the distributed nature of these systems introduces several performance challenges, e.g., disk I/O and network shuffling overhead, especially for RDF queries that involve multiple join operations. To alleviate these challenges, this paper studies the effect of several optimization techniques that enhance the performance of RDF queries. Based on the query workload, reduced sets of intermediate results (or reductions, for short) that are common for certain join pattern(s) are computed. Furthermore, these reductions are not computed beforehand, but are rather computed only for the frequent join patterns in an online fashion using Bloom filters. Rather than caching the final results of each query, we show that caching the reductions allows reusing intermediate results across multiple queries that share the same join patterns. In addition, we introduce an efficient solution for RDF queries with unbound properties. Based on a realization of the proposed optimizations on top of Spark, extensive experimentation using two synthetic benchmarks and a real dataset demonstrates how these optimizations lead to an order of magnitude enhancement in terms of preprocessing, storage, and query performance compared to the state-of-the-art solutions.",,,,,,WORQ: Workload-Driven RDF Query Processing,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00671-6_34,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

Moreover, one important factor of query answering on Web data is its provenance, i.e., metadata about its origin. Some applications in data analytics and access control require to augment the data with provenance metadata and run queries that impose constraints on this provenance. This task is called provenance-aware query answering.

These ontologies need to evolve regularly in response to changes in the domain and the emergence of new requirements. An important step of this process is the selection of candidate concepts to include in the new version of the ontology. This operation needs to take into account a variety of factors and in particular reconcile user requirements and application performance. Current ontology evolution methods focus either on ranking concepts according to their relevance or on preserving compatibility with existing applications. However, they do not take in consideration the impact of the ontology evolution process on the performance of computational tasks – e.g., in this work we focus on instance tagging, similarity computation, generation of recommendations, and data clustering. In this paper, we propose the Pragmatic Ontology Evolution (POE) framework, a novel approach for selecting from a group of candidates a set of concepts able to produce a new version of a given ontology that (i) is consistent with the a set of user requirements (e.g., max number of concepts in the ontology), (ii) is parametrised with respect to a number of dimensions (e.g., topological considerations), and (iii) effectively supports relevant computational tasks. Our approach also supports users in navigating the space of possible solutions by showing how certain choices, such as limiting the number of concepts or privileging trendy concepts rather than historical ones, would reflect on the application performance.

In this paper we present a Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) model that leverages ontological entity classes to relate NLP annotations from different tasks insisting on the same entity mentions. The intuition behind the model is that an annotation likely implies some ontological classes on the entity identified by the mention, and annotations from different tasks on the same mention have to share more or less the same implied entity classes. In a setting with various NLP tools returning multiple, confidence-weighted, candidate annotations on a single mention, the model can be operationally applied to compare the different annotation combinations, and to possibly revise the tools’ best annotation choice.

So it is difficult to learn high-quality rules from the KG alone, and scalability dictates that only a small set of candidate rules could be generated. Therefore, the ranking and pruning of candidate rules are major problems. To address this issue, we propose a rule learning method that utilizes probabilistic representations of missing facts.

In TEEs, each entity is represented by a vector that represents the entity and its type, which is learned from entity mentions found in a text corpus. Inspired by evidence from cognitive sciences and application-oriented concerns, we propose an approach to encode representations of years into TEEs by aggregating the representations of the entities that occur in event-based descriptions of the years. These representations are used to define two time-aware similarity measures to control the implicit effect of time on entity similarity.

These changes impact the engine’s performance and reliability. We propose Strider, a hybrid adaptive distributed RDF Stream Processing engine that optimizes logical query plan according to the state of data streams. Strider has been designed to guarantee important industrial properties such as scalability, high availability, fault tolerance, high throughput and acceptable latency. These guarantees are obtained by designing the engine’s architecture with state-of-the-art Apache components such as Spark and Kafka. We highlight the efficiency (e.g., on a single machine machine, up to 60x gain on throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems, a throughput of 3.1 million triples/second on a 9 machines cluster, a major breakthrough in this system’s category) of Strider on real-world and synthetic data sets.",,,,,,Strider: A Hybrid Adaptive Distributed RDF Stream Processing Engine,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-68288-4_33,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

For instance, in an RDF graph about drugs, we may want to compare Metamizole and Ibuprofen and automatically find out that they are similar in that they are both analgesics but, in contrast to Metamizole, Ibuprofen also has a considerable anti-inflammatory effect. Entity comparison is a widely used functionality available in many information systems, such as universities or product comparison websites.

To overcome these challenges, most federated query engines rely on heuristics to reduce the space of possible query execution plans or on dynamic programming strategies to produce optimal plans. Nevertheless, these plans may still exhibit a high number of intermediate results or high execution times because of heuristics and inaccurate cost estimations. In this paper, we present Odyssey, an approach that uses statistics that allow for a more accurate cost estimation for federated queries and therefore enables Odyssey to produce better query execution plans.

A large collection of ontologies and 10 well-known reasoners are studied. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs significantly better than several state-of-the-art ranking solutions. Furthermore, it proves that our introduced ranking method could effectively be evolved to a competitive meta-reasoner.",,,,,,Multi-label Based Learning for Better Multi-criteria Ranking of Ontology Reasoners,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-68288-4_1,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

At its core, Laser implements a novel evaluation procedure which annotates formulae to avoid the re-computation of duplicates at multiple time points. This procedure, combined with a judicious implementation of the LARS operators, is responsible for significantly better runtimes than the ones of other state-of-the-art systems like C-SPARQL and CQELS, or an implementation of LARS which runs on the ASP solver Clingo.

The Manchester OWL Syntax (MOS) was developed as an alternative to symbolic description logic (DL) and it is believed to be more effective for users. This paper sets out to test that belief from two perspectives by evaluating how accurately and quickly people understand the informational content of axioms and derive inferences from them. By conducting a between-group empirical study, involving 60 novice participants, we found that DL is just as effective as MOS for people’s understanding of axioms. Moreover, for two types of inference problems, DL supported significantly better task performance than MOS, yet MOS never significantly outperformed DL. These surprising results suggest that the belief that MOS is more effective than DL, at least for these types of task, is unfounded. An outcome of this research is the suggestion that ontology axioms, when presented to non-experts, may be better presented in DL rather than MOS.

Latent variable models have increasingly gained attention for the statistical modeling of knowledge graphs, showing promising results in tasks related to knowledge graph completion and cleaning. Besides storing facts about the world, schema-based knowledge graphs are backed by rich semantic descriptions of entities and relation-types that allow machines to understand the notion of things and their semantic relationships. In this work, we study how type-constraints can generally support the statistical modeling with latent variable models. More precisely, we integrated prior knowledge in form of type-constraints in various state of the art latent variable approaches. Our experimental results show that prior knowledge on relation-types significantly improves these models up to 77% in link-prediction tasks. The achieved improvements are especially prominent when a low model complexity is enforced, a crucial requirement when these models are applied to very large datasets.

An important feature inherited from the modal approach is that the inference rules are guided by an ordering compatible with the elimination order of the concept symbols. This provides more control over the inference process and reduces non-determinism, resulting in a smaller search space. The method is extended with a new case splitting inference rule, and several simplification rules. Compared to related forgetting and uniform interpolation methods for description logics, the method can handle inverse roles, nominals and ABoxes. Compared to the modal approach on which it is based, it is more efficient in time and improves the success rates. The method has been implemented in Java using the OWL API.

While existing ontology-editing tools and methodologies propose ways of building ontologies in a normative way, empirical investigations of how experts actually construct ontologies “in the wild” are rare. Yet, understanding actual user behavior can play an important role in the design of effective tool support. Although previous empirical investigations have produced a series of interesting insights, they were exploratory in nature and aimed at gauging the problem space only. In this work, we aim to advance the state of knowledge in this domain by systematically defining and comparing a set of hypotheses about how users edit ontologies. Towards that end, we study the user editing trails of four real-world ontology-engineering projects. Using a coherent research framework, called HypTrails, we derive formal definitions of hypotheses from the literature, and systematically compare them with each other. Our findings suggest that the hierarchical structure of an ontology exercises the strongest influence on user editing behavior, followed by the entity similarity, and the semantic distance of classes in the ontology. Moreover, these findings are strikingly consistent across all ontology-engineering projects in our study, with only minor exceptions for one of the smaller datasets.

In order to make sense of and explore this large-scale body of knowledge we need an accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date ontology of research topics. Unfortunately, human crafted classifications do not satisfy these criteria, as they evolve too slowly and tend to be too coarse-grained. Current automated methods for generating ontologies of research areas also present a number of limitations, such as: i) they do not consider the rich amount of indirect statistical and semantic relationships, which can help to understand the relation between two topics – e.g., the fact that two research areas are associated with a similar set of venues or technologies; ii) they do not distinguish between different kinds of hierarchical relationships; and iii) they are not able to handle effectively ambiguous topics characterized by a noisy set of relationships.

A class of DL ontologies called the inconsistency-based first-order rewritable (IFO-rewritable) class is identified. This class guarantees that instance retrieval for an atomic negation can be reduced to answering a disjunction of conjunctive queries (CQs) over the ABox. The IFO-rewritable class is more expressive than the first-order rewritable class which guarantees that answering a CQ is reducible to answering a disjunction of CQs over the ABox regardless of the TBox. Two sufficient conditions are proposed to detect IFO-rewritable ontologies that are not first-order rewritable.

Our evaluation shows that such vector representations outperform existing techniques for the propositionalization of RDF graphs on a variety of different predictive machine learning tasks, and that feature vector representations of general knowledge graphs such as DBpedia and Wikidata can be easily reused for different tasks.",,,,,,RDF2Vec: RDF Graph Embeddings for Data Mining,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46523-4_30,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

We present a novel approach to automatically discover the semantic relations within a given data source. We mine the small graph patterns occurring in Linked Open Data and combine them to build a graph that will be used to infer semantic relations.

Previous approaches use machine learning to learn a model that extracts features related to the data of a domain, which requires the model to be re-trained for every new domain. Our solution uses similarity metrics as features to compare against labeled domain data and learns a matching function to infer the correct semantic labels for data. Since our approach depends on the learned similarity metrics but not the data itself, it is domain-independent and only needs to be trained once to work effectively across multiple domains.

Since user activities can be represented in terms of relationships involving three or more things (e.g. a user tags movie items on a webpage), tensors are an attractive approach to represent them. The recently introduced Semantic Sensitive Tensor Factorization (SSTF) is promising as it achieves high accuracy in predicting users’ activities by basing tensor factorization on the semantics behind objects (e.g. item categories). However, SSTF currently focuses on the factorization of a tensor for a single service and thus has two problems: (1) the balance problem occurs when handling heterogeneous datasets simultaneously, and (2) the sparsity problem triggered by insufficient observations within a single service. Our solution, Semantic Sensitive Simultaneous Tensor Factorization (S\(^3\)TF), tackles the problems by: (1) Creating tensors for individual services and factorizing them simultaneously; it does not force the creation of a tensor from multiple services and factorize the single tensor. This avoids the low prediction accuracy caused by the balance problem. (2) Utilizing shared semantics behind distributed activity logs and assigning semantic bias to each tensor factorization. This avoids the sparsity problem by sharing semantics among services. Experiments using real-world datasets show that S\(^3\)TF achieves higher accuracy in rating prediction than the current best tensor method.

However, as we will illustrate, Open Data tables typically contain a large portion of numerical columns and/or non-textual headers; therefore solutions that solely focus on textual “cues” are only partially applicable for mapping such data sources. We propose an approach to find and rank candidates of semantic labels and context descriptions for a given bag of numerical values. To this end, we apply a hierarchical clustering over information taken from DBpedia to build a background knowledge graph of possible “semantic contexts” for bags of numerical values, over which we perform a nearest neighbour search to rank the most likely candidates.

To this end, the query engine requires a traversal strategy that enables the engine to fetch result-relevant data as early as possible. The challenge for such a strategy is that the query engine does not know a priori which of the data sources discovered during the query execution will contain result-relevant data. In this paper, we investigate 14 different approaches to rank traversal steps and achieve a variety of traversal strategies. We experimentally study their impact on response times and compare them to a baseline that resembles a breadth-first traversal.

In these applications, one query pattern is especially prominent: a join between a continuous data stream and some background data (BGD). Oftentimes, the target BGD is large, maintained externally, changing slowly, and costly to query (both in terms of time and money). Hence, practical applications usually maintain a local (cached) view of the relevant BGD. Given that these caches are not updated as the original BGD, they should be refreshed under realistic budget constraints (in terms of latency, computation time, and possibly financial cost) to avoid stale data leading to wrong answers. This paper proposes to model the join between streams and the BGD as a bipartite graph. By exploiting the graph structure, we keep the quality of results good enough without refreshing the entire cache for each evaluation. We also introduce two extensions to this method: first, we consider a continuous join between recent portions of a data stream and some BGD to focus on updates that have the longest effect. Second, we consider the future impact of a query to the BGD by proposing to delay some updates to provide fresher answers in future.

The contextual tag cloud system is a novel application that helps users explore a large scale RDF dataset: the tags are ontological terms (classes and properties), the context is a set of tags that defines a subset of instances, and the font sizes reflect the number of instances that use each tag. It visualizes the patterns of instances specified by the context a user constructs. Given a request with a specific context, the system needs to quickly find what other tags the instances in the context use, and how many instances in the context use each tag. The key question we answer in this paper is how to scale to Linked Data; in particular we use a dataset with 1.4 billion triples and over 380,000 tags. This is complicated by the fact that the calculation should, when directed by the user, consider the entailment of taxonomic and/or domain/range axioms in the ontology. We combine a scalable preprocessing approach with a specially-constructed inverted index and use three approaches to prune unnecessary counts for faster intersection computations.

A common problem is the imprecision in the use of vocabularies: annotators can misunderstand the semantics of a class or property or may not be able to find the right objects to annotate with. This decreases the quality of data and may eventually hamper its usability over large scale. This paper describes Statistical Knowledge Patterns (SKP) as a means to address this issue. SKPs encapsulate key information about ontology classes, including synonymous properties in (and across) datasets, and are automatically generated based on statistical data analysis. SKPs can be effectively used to automatically normalise data, and hence increase recall in querying. Both pattern extraction and pattern usage are completely automated. The main benefits of SKPs are that: (1) their structure allows for both accurate query expansion and restriction; (2) they are context dependent, hence they describe the usage and meaning of properties in the context of a particular class; and (3) they can be generated offline, hence the equivalence among relations can be used efficiently at run time.",,,,,,Statistical Knowledge Patterns: Identifying Synonymous Relations in Large Linked Datasets,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-41335-3_44,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

However, quite a few hyperlinks have not been anotated by editors in infoboxes, which causes lots of relations between entities being missing in Wikipedia. In this paper, we propose an approach for automatically discovering the missing entity links in Wikipedia’s infoboxes, so that the missing semantic relations between entities can be established. Our approach first identifies entity mentions in the given infoboxes, and then computes several features to estimate the possibilities that a given attribute value might link to a candidate entity. A learning model is used to obtain the weights of different features, and predict the destination entity for each attribute value.

For this reason, Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs) increasingly contain information about the searched entities such as pictures, short summaries, related entities, and factual information. A key facet that is often displayed on the SERPs and that is instrumental for many applications is the entity type. However, an entity is usually not associated to a single generic type in the background knowledge bases but rather to a set of more specific types, which may be relevant or not given the document context. For example, one can find on the Linked Open Data cloud the fact that Tom Hanks is a person, an actor, and a person from Concord, California. All those types are correct but some may be too general to be interesting (e.g., person), while other may be interesting but already known to the user (e.g., actor), or may be irrelevant given the current browsing context (e.g., person from Concord, California). In this paper, we define the new task of ranking entity types given an entity and its context. We propose and evaluate new methods to find the most relevant entity type based on collection statistics and on the graph structure interconnecting entities and types. An extensive experimental evaluation over several document collections at different levels of granularity (e.g., sentences, paragraphs, etc.) and different type hierarchies (including DBPedia, Freebase, and schema.org) shows that hierarchy-based approaches provide more accurate results when picking entity types to be displayed to the end-user while still being highly scalable.",,,,,,TRank: Ranking Entity Types Using the Web of Data,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-41335-3_40,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

Further, these sources capture complementary but also redundant information about entities.

In addition to this, as current research on ontology matching does not make a satisfactory distinction between multilingual and cross-lingual ontology matching, we provide precise definitions of these terms in relation to monolingual ontology matching, and quantify their effects on different matching algorithms.",,,,,,A Machine Learning Approach to Multilingual and Cross-Lingual Ontology Matching,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-25073-6_42,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

Consequently, it is of central importance during the implementation of any of these applications to have a clear picture of the weaknesses and strengths of current triple store implementations. In this paper, we propose a generic SPARQL benchmark creation procedure, which we apply to the DBpedia knowledge base. Previous approaches often compared relational and triple stores and, thus, settled on measuring performance against a relational database which had been converted to RDF by using SQL-like queries. In contrast to those approaches, our benchmark is based on queries that were actually issued by humans and applications against existing RDF data not resembling a relational schema. Our generic procedure for benchmark creation is based on query-log mining, clustering and SPARQL feature analysis. We argue that a pure SPARQL benchmark is more useful to compare existing triple stores and provide results for the popular triple store implementations Virtuoso, Sesame, Jena-TDB, and BigOWLIM.

However, the massive size and distributed nature of RDF data calls for approaches to learning from RDF data in a setting where the data can be accessed only through a query interface, e.g., the SPARQL endpoint of the RDF store. In applications where the data are subject to frequent updates, there is a need for algorithms that allow the predictive model to be incrementally updated in response to changes in the data. Furthermore, in some applications, the attributes that are relevant for specific prediction tasks are not known a priori and hence need to be discovered by the algorithm. We present an approach to learning Relational Bayesian Classifiers (RBCs) from RDF data that addresses such scenarios. Specifically, we show how to build RBCs from RDF data using statistical queries through the SPARQL endpoint of the RDF store. We compare the communication complexity of our algorithm with one that requires direct centralized access to the data and hence has to retrieve the entire RDF dataset from the remote location for processing. We establish the conditions under which the RBC models can be incrementally updated in response to addition or deletion of RDF data.

Linked Stream Data consists of data generated by stream sources, e.g., sensors, enriched with semantic descriptions, following the standards proposed for Linked Data. This enables the integration of stream data with Linked Data collections and facilitates a wide range of novel applications. Currently available systems use a “black box” approach which delegates the processing to other engines such as stream/event processing engines and SPARQL query processors by translating to their provided languages. As the experimental results described in this paper show, the need for query translation and data transformation, as well as the lack of full control over the query execution, pose major drawbacks in terms of efficiency. To remedy these drawbacks, we present CQELS (Continuous Query Evaluation over Linked Streams), a native and adaptive query processor for unified query processing over Linked Stream Data and Linked Data. In contrast to the existing systems, CQELS uses a “white box” approach and implements the required query operators natively to avoid the overhead and limitations of closed system regimes. CQELS provides a flexible query execution framework with the query processor dynamically adapting to the changes in the input data. During query execution, it continuously reorders operators according to some heuristics to achieve improved query execution in terms of delay and complexity. Moreover, external disk access on large Linked Data collections is reduced with the use of data encoding and caching of intermediate query results. To demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, we present extensive experimental performance evaluations in terms of query execution time, under varied query types, dataset sizes, and number of parallel queries.

Because of the ambiguity of keyword queries, it is often not possible to generate a unique interpretation for a keyword query. Consequently, heuristics geared toward generating the top-K likeliest user-intended interpretations have been proposed. However, heuristics currently proposed fail to capture any user-dependent characteristics, but rather depend on database-dependent properties such as occurrence frequency of subgraph pattern connecting keywords. This leads to the problem of generating top-K interpretations that are not aligned with user intentions. In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for keyword query interpretation that personalizes the interpretation process based on a user’s query context. Our approach addresses the novel problem of using a sequence of structured queries corresponding to interpretations of keyword queries in the query history as contextual information for biasing the interpretation of a new query.

Querying languages, such as SPARQL, offer expressive means for searching RDF datasets, but they are difficult to use. Query assistants help users to write well-formed queries, but they do not prevent empty results. Faceted search supports exploratory search, i.e., guided navigation that returns rich feedbacks to users, and prevents them to fall in dead-ends (empty results). However, faceted search systems do not offer the same expressiveness as query languages. We introduce Query-based Faceted Search (QFS), the combination of an expressive query language and faceted search, to reconcile the two paradigms. In this paper, the LISQL query language generalizes existing semantic faceted search systems, and covers most features of SPARQL. A prototype, Sewelis (aka.

A number of (semi-)automated alignment systems have been proposed in recent years. Most combine a set of similarity functions on lexical, semantic and structural features to align ontologies. Although these functions work well in many cases of ontology alignments, they fail to capture alignments when terms or structure varies vastly across ontologies. In this case, one is forced to rely on manual alignment. In this paper, we study whether it is feasible to re-use such expert provided ontology alignments for new alignment tasks. We focus in particular on many-to-one alignments, where the opportunity for re-use is feasible if alignments are stable. Specifically, we define the notion of a cluster as being made of multiple entities in the source ontology \(\mathcal{S}\) that are mapped to the same entity in the target ontology \(\mathcal{T}\). We test the stability hypothesis that the formed clusters of source ontology are stable across alignments to different target ontologies. If this hypothesis is valid, the clusters of an ontology \(\mathcal{S}\), built from an existing alignment with an ontology \(\mathcal{T}\), can be effectively exploited to align \(\mathcal{S}\) with a new ontology \(\mathcal{T}'\). Evaluation on both manual and automated high-quality alignments show remarkable stability of clusters across ontology alignments in the financial domain and the healthcare and life sciences domain.

The ongoing transition from the current Web of unstructured data to the Web of Data yet requires scalable and accurate approaches for the extraction of structured data in RDF (Resource Description Framework) from these websites. One of the key steps towards extracting RDF from text is the disambiguation of named entities. While several approaches aim to tackle this problem, they still achieve poor accuracy. We address this drawback by presenting AGDISTIS, a novel knowledge-base-agnostic approach for named entity disambiguation. Our approach combines the Hypertext-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm with label expansion strategies and string similarity measures. Based on this combination, AGDISTIS can efficiently detect the correct URIs for a given set of named entities within an input text. We evaluate our approach on eight different datasets against state-of-the-art named entity disambiguation frameworks.

Solving this problem would be required for such clear use-cases as the creation of version control systems for RDF. While some provenance models and annotation techniques for storing and querying provenance data originally developed with databases or workflows in mind transfer readily to RDF and SPARQL, these techniques do not readily adapt to describing changes in dynamic RDF datasets over time. In this paper we explore how to adapt the dynamic copy-paste provenance model of Buneman et al.[2] to RDF datasets that change over time in response to SPARQL updates, how to represent the resulting provenance records themselves as RDF in a manner compatible with W3C PROV, and how the provenance information can be defined by reinterpreting SPARQL updates.

We observe that by compiling the ontological entailments as mappings, implementing the mappings as SQL views and materializing a subset of the views, the underlying SQL optimizer is able to reduce the execution time of a SPARQL query by rewriting the query in terms of the views specified by the mappings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first OBDA system supporting ontologies with transitivity by using SQL recursion. Our contributions include: (1) an efficient algorithm to compile ontological entailments as mappings; (2) a proof that every SPARQL query can be rewritten into a SQL query in the context of mappings; (3) a cost model to determine which views to materialize to attain the fastest execution time; and (4) an empirical evaluation comparing with a state-of-the-art OBDA system, which validates the cost model and demonstrates favorable execution times.",,,,,,"OBDA: Query Rewriting or Materialization?

In this paper, we study the problem of noisy type assertion detection in semantic web datasets by making use of concept disjointness relationships hidden in the datasets. We transform noisy type assertion detection into multiclass classification of pairs of type assertions which type an individual to two potential disjoint concepts.

To tackle these challenges, it should be possible to benchmark mobile reasoning performance across different mobile platforms, with rule- and datasets of varying scale and complexity and existing reasoning process flows.

One solution to this is to include users’ preferences for semantic (i.e. linked data) categories, however this approach is limited should a user be presented with an item for which he has not rated the semantic categories previously; so called cold-start categories.

In this paper, we devise an extension of the federation of Linked Data to data consumers.

A data consumer can update her local copy and share updates with data providers and consumers. Update sharing improves general data quality, and replicated data creates opportunities for federated query engines to improve availability.

Instead of only considering the existing concepts present in each ontology, we hypothesize new composite concepts defined as disjunctions of conjunctions of (RDF) types and value restrictions, which we call restriction classes, and generate alignments between these composite concepts. This extended concept language enables us to find more complete definitions and to even align sources that have rudimentary ontologies, such as those that are simple renderings of relational databases.

This class of solutions promises both to facilitate the integration of research data with other relevant sources of information and also to support more intelligent forms of querying and exploration. However, an issue which has only been partially addressed is that of generating and characterizing semantically the relations that exist between research areas. This problem has been traditionally addressed by manually creating taxonomies, such as the ACM classification of research topics. However, this manual approach is inadequate for a number of reasons: these taxonomies are very coarse-grained and they do not cater for the fine-grained research topics, which define the level at which typically researchers (and even more so, PhD students) operate. Moreover, they evolve slowly, and therefore they tend not to cover the most recent research trends.

First, we divide the users’ transactions into epochs i.e. time periods, and identify epochs that are dominated by interests similar to the current interests of the active user. Thus, it can eliminate dissimilar transactions while making use of similar transactions that exist in prior epochs. Second, we use a taxonomy of items to model user item transactions in each epoch. This well captures the interests of users in each epoch even if there are few transactions. It suits the situations in which the items transacted by users dynamically change over time; the semantics behind classes do not change so often while individual items often appear and disappear. Fortunately, many taxonomies are now available on the web because of the spread of the Linked Open Data vision. We can now use those to understand dynamic user interests semantically.

First, it is often quite difficult to even determine which concepts have had their meaning altered by a change. Second, once a concept change is pinpointed, the problem of distinguishing whether the concept is directly or indirectly affected by a change has yet to be tackled. To address the first issue, various principled notions of “semantic diff” (based on deductive inseparability) have been proposed in the literature and shown to be computationally practical for the expressively restricted case of \({\mathcal ELH}^r\)-terminologies. However, problems arise even for such limited logics as \({\mathcal ALC}\): First, computation gets more difficult, becoming undecidable for logics such as \({\mathcal SROIQ}\) which underly the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Second, the presence of negation and disjunction make the standard semantic difference too sensitive to change: essentially, any logically effectual change always affects all terms in the ontology. In order to tackle these issues, we formulate the central notion of finding the minimal change set based on model inseparability, and present a method to differentiate changes which are specific to (thus directly affect) particular concept names. Subsequently we devise a series of computable approximations, and compare the variously approximated change sets over a series of versions of the NCI Thesaurus (NCIt).",,,,,,Concept-Based Semantic Difference in Expressive Description Logics,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-35176-1_7,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

Even very experienced modellers with a sophisticated grasp of reasoning algorithms do not have a good mental model of reasoner performance behaviour. Seemingly innocuous changes to an OWL ontology can degrade classification time from instantaneous to too long to wait for. Similarly, switching reasoners (e.g., to take advantage of specific features) can result in wildly different classification times. In this paper we investigate performance variability phenomena in OWL ontologies, and present methods to identify subsets of an ontology which are performance-degrading for a given reasoner. When such (ideally small) subsets are removed from an ontology, and the remainder is much easier for the given reasoner to reason over, we designate them “hot spots”. The identification of these hot spots allows users to isolate difficult portions of the ontology in a principled and systematic way. Moreover, we devise and compare various methods for approximate reasoning and knowledge compilation based on hot spots. We verify our techniques with a select set of varyingly difficult ontologies from the NCBO BioPortal, and were able to, firstly, successfully identify performance hot spots against the major freely available DL reasoners, and, secondly, significantly improve classification time using approximate reasoning based on hot spots.",,,,,,Performance Heterogeneity and Approximate Reasoning in Description Logic Ontologies,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-35176-1_6,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

In this paper we present an approach to Web service composition that builds on work using AI planning, and more specifically Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs), for Web service composition. A significant advantage of our approach is that it provides much of the how-to knowledge of a choreography while enabling customization and optimization of integrated Web service selection and composition based upon the needs of the specific problem, the preferences of the customer, and the available services. Many customers must also be concerned with enforcement of regulations, perhaps in the form of corporate policies and/or government regulations. Regulations are traditionally enforced at design time by verifying that a workflow or composition adheres to regulations. Our approach supports customization, optimization and regulation enforcement all at composition construction time.

Many methods have been proposed for automatically finding the alignment between heterogeneous ontologies. However, in many real-world applications, finding the alignment in a completely automatic way is highly infeasible. Ideally, an ontology matching system would have an interactive interface to allow users to provide feedbacks to guide the automatic algorithm. Fundamentally, we need answer the following questions: How can a system perform an efficiently interactive process with the user? How many interactions are sufficient for finding a more accurate matching? To address these questions, we propose an active learning framework for ontology matching, which tries to find the most informative candidate matches to query the user. The user’s feedbacks are used to: 1) correct the mistake matching and 2) propagate the supervise information to help the entire matching process. Three measures are proposed to estimate the confidence of each matching candidate. A correct propagation algorithm is further proposed to maximize the spread of the user’s “guidance”. Experimental results on several public data sets show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the matching accuracy (+8.0% better than the baseline methods).",,,,,,Actively Learning Ontology Matching via User Interaction,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-04930-9_37,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

There are many matching systems that generate mappings between different ontologies either automatically or semi-automatically. However, the mappings generated by these systems may be inconsistent with the ontologies. Several approaches have been proposed to deal with the inconsistencies between mappings and ontologies. This problem is often called a mapping revision problem, as the ontologies are assumed to be correct, whereas the mappings are repaired when resolving the inconsistencies. In this paper, we first propose a conflict-based mapping revision operator and show that it can be characterized by two logical postulates adapted from some existing postulates for belief base revision. We then provide an algorithm for iterative mapping revision by using an ontology revision operator and show that this algorithm defines a conflict-based mapping revision operator. Three concrete ontology revision operators are given to instantiate the iterative algorithm, which result in three different mapping revision algorithms.

Large amounts and high diversity of knowledge in the Semantic Web pose the challenging question of appropriate relevance ranking for producing fine-grained and rich descriptions of the available data, e.g. to guide the user along most promising knowledge aspects. Existing methods for graph-based authority ranking lack support for fine-grained latent coherence between resources and predicates (i.e. support for link semantics in the linked data model). In this paper, we present TripleRank, a novel approach for faceted authority ranking in the context of RDF knowledge bases. TripleRank captures the additional latent semantics of Semantic Web data by means of statistical methods in order to produce richer descriptions of the available data. We model the Semantic Web by a 3-dimensional tensor that enables the seamless representation of arbitrary semantic links. For the analysis of that model, we apply the PARAFAC decomposition, which can be seen as a multi-modal counterpart to Web authority ranking with HITS. The result are groupings of resources and predicates that characterize their authority and navigational (hub) properties with respect to identified topics.

For more advanced and domain-specific evolution and refactorings, several simple evolution patterns can be combined into a compound one. We performed a comprehensive survey of possible evolution patterns with a combinatorial analysis of all possible before/after combinations, resulting in an extensive catalog of usable evolution patterns.

While in the past, the unavailability of rich and complete semantic descriptions constituted a serious limitation of their applicability, nowadays, the Semantic Web made available a large amount of logically encoded information (e.g. ontologies, RDF(S)-data, linked data, etc.), which constitutes a valuable source of semantics. However, web semantics cannot be easily plugged into machine learning systems. Therefore the objective of this paper is to define a reference methodology for combining semantic information available in the web under the form of logical theories, with statistical methods for NLP.

In this paper, we present a new approach to performance analysis based on justifications for entailments of OWL ontologies. Justifications are minimal subsets of an ontology that are sufficient for an entailment to hold, and are commonly used to debug OWL ontologies. In JustBench, justifications form the key unit of test, which means that individual justifications are tested for correctness and reasoner performance instead of entire ontologies or random subsets. Justifications are generally small and relatively easy to analyse, which makes them very suitable for transparent analytic micro-benchmarks. Furthermore, the JustBench approach also allows us to isolate reasoner errors and inconsistent behaviour. We present the results of initial experiments using JustBench with FaCT++, HermiT, and Pellet. Finally, we show how JustBench can be used by reasoner developers and ontology engineers seeking to understand and improve the performance characteristics of reasoners and ontologies.",,,,,,JustBench: A Framework for OWL Benchmarking,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-17746-0_3,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb
ISWC 2010,https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-17746-0,2010,"The availability of streaming data sources is progressively increasing thanks to the development of ubiquitous data capturing technologies such as sensor networks. The heterogeneity of these sources introduces the requirement of providing data access in a unified and coherent manner, whilst allowing the user to express their needs at an ontological level. In this paper we describe an ontology-based streaming data access service. Sources link their data content to ontologies through s 2o mappings. Users can query the ontology using sparql Stream, an extension of sparql for streaming data. A preliminary implementation of the approach is also presented. With this proposal we expect to set the basis for future efforts in ontology-based streaming data integration.",,,,,,Enabling Ontology-Based Access to Streaming Data Sources,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-17746-0_7,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb

In this paper, we propose an approach to performing belief base revision for Datalog+/- ontologies. We define a kernel based belief revision operator for Datalog+/- and study its properties using extended postulates, as well as an algorithm to revise Datalog+/- ontologies. Finally, we give the complexity results by showing that query answering for a revised linear Datalog+/- ontology is tractable.",,,,,,Belief Base Revision for Datalog+/- Ontologies,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-06826-8_14,,ISWC,conf,https://link.springer.com/conference/semweb
